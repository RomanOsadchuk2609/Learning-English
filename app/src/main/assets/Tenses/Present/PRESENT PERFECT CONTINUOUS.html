	<h1 class="page-title">Present Perfect Continuous</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The present perfect continuous is used to refer to an <strong>unspecified time</strong> between 'before now' and 'now'. The speaker is thinking about something that started but perhaps did not finish in that period of time. He/she is interested in the <strong>process as well as the result,</strong> and this process may still be going on, or may have just finished.</p>
		<h4>Actions that started in the past and continue in the present</h4>
		<p>She <strong>has been waiting</strong> for you all day (= and she's still waiting now).<br>
		<strong>I've been working</strong> on this report since eight o'clock this morning (= and I still haven't finished it).<br>
		<strong>They have been travelling</strong> since last October (= and they're not home yet).</p>
		<h4>Actions that have just finished, but we are interested in the results</h4>
		<p><strong>She has been cooking</strong> since last night (= and the food on the table looks delicious).<br>
		<strong>It's been raining</strong> (= and the streets are still wet).<br>
		<strong>Someone's been eating</strong> my chips (= half of them have gone).</p>
		<h3>Forming the Present Perfect Continuous</h3>
		<p>The present perfect continuous is made up of two elements: the present perfect of the verb <em>'to be'</em> (have/has been), and the present participle of the main verb (base+ing)</p>
		<table>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Subject</strong></td>
					<td><strong>has/have been</strong></td>
					<td><strong>base+ing</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>She</td>
					<td>has been</td>
					<td>swimming</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p><strong>Affirmative</strong>: She has been / She's been running.<br>
		<strong>Negative</strong>: She hasn't been running.<br>
		<strong>Interrogative</strong> : Has she been running?<br>
		<strong>Interrogative negative</strong>: Hasn't she been running?</p>

			<h5>Example: present perfect continuous, TO LIVE</h5>

		<h3>Verbs without continuous forms</h3>
		<p>With verbs not normally used in the continuous form, use the simple present perfect instead (verbs such as: know, hate, hear, understand, want).<br>
		<strong>I've wanted</strong> to visit China for years.<br>
		<strong>She's known</strong> Robert since she was a child.<br>
		<strong>I've hated</strong> that music since I first heard it.<br>
		<strong>I've heard</strong> a lot about you recently.<br>
		<strong>We've understood</strong> everything.</p>
