	<h1 class="page-title">Using &quot;half&quot; as a distributive</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The distributive determiner <em>half</em> is used to talk about a whole group divided in two. <em>Half</em> can be used as a distributive in several different patterns. Other fractions can be used in the same patterns, although they are less frequent.</p>
		<p><em>Half</em> can be used with measurements preceeded by an indefinite article (<em>a</em> or <em>an</em>). In this usage, it refers to a measurement.</p>

				<li>I bought <strong>half a kilo</strong> of flour.</li>
				<li>He ran <strong>half a mile</strong> this morning.</li>
				<li>I will be back in <strong>half a minute</strong>.</li>
			</ul>

		<p><em>Half</em> can be used with nouns preceeded by <em>the</em>, <em>a</em>, a demonstrative, or a possessive adjective. In this case, the meaning refers to a concrete, physical division. The word <em>of</em> can be added just after <em>half</em> with no change in meaning.</p>
