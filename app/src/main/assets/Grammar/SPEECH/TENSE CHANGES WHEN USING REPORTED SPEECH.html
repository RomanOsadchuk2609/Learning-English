		<p>You do not need to change the tense if the reporting verb is in the present, or if the original statement was about something that is still true, e.g.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>He says <strong>he has missed</strong> the train but <strong>he'll catch</strong> the next one.</li>
			<li>We explained that <strong>it is</strong> very difficult to find our house.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>These modal verbs do not change in reported speech: <em>might, could, would, should, ought to</em>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We explained, "It <strong>could</strong> be difficult to find our house." = We explained that it <strong>could</strong> be difficult to find our house.</li>
			<li>She said, "I <strong>might</strong> bring a friend to the party." = She said that she <strong>might</strong> bring a friend to the party.</li>
		</ul>
