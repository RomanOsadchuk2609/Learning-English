<p>The difference between these two words is a very simple one. They are the past tenses of two different verbs. </p>
<p>'<strong>Bought'</strong> is the past tense of 'buy': I bought a new car last week. </p>
<p>'<strong>Brought'</strong> is the past tense of 'bring': I brought him a glass of water. </p>
<p>The difference can be remembered easily too, as 'bring' shares its first two letters with 'brought' ('br').&nbsp; </p>
