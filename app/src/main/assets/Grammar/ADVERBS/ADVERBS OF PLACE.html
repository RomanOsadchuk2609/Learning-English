	<div class="content">
		<p>Adverbs of place tell us <b>where</b> something happens. Adverbs of place are usually placed after the main verb or after the clause that they modify. Adverbs of place do not modify adjectives or other adverbs. Some examples of adverbs of place: here, everywhere, outside, away, around</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>John looked <strong>around</strong> but he couldn't see the monkey.</li>
				<li>I searched <strong>everywhere</strong> I could think of.</li>
				<li>I'm going <strong>back</strong> to school.</li>
				<li>Come <strong>in</strong>!</li>
				<li>They built a house <strong>nearby</strong>.</li>
				<li>She took the child <strong>outside</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Here and There</h3>
		<p><em>Here</em> and <em>there</em> are common adverbs of place. They give a location relative to the speaker. With verbs of movement, <em>here</em> means "towards or with the speaker" and <em>there</em> means "away from, or not with the speaker".</p>

					<th>Sentence</th>
					<th>Meaning</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Come here!</td>
					<td>Come towards me.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The table is in here.</td>
					<td>Come with me; we will go see it together.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Put it there.</td>
					<td>Put it in a place away from me.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The table is in there.</td>
					<td>Go in; you can see it by yourself.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p><em>Here</em> and <em>there</em> are combined with prepositions to make many common adverbial phrases.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>What are you doing <strong>up there</strong>?</li>
				<li>Come <strong>over here</strong> and look at what I found!</li>
				<li>The baby is hiding <strong>down there</strong> under the table.</li>
				<li>I wonder how my driver's license got stuck <strong>under here</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>Here</em> and <em>there</em> are placed at the beginning of the sentence in exclamations or when emphasis is needed. They are followed by the verb if the subject is a noun or by a pronoun if the subject is a pronoun.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Here</strong> comes the bus!</li>
				<li><strong>There</strong> goes the bell!</li>
				<li><strong>There</strong> it is!</li>
				<li><strong>Here</strong> they are!</li>

		<h3>Adverbs of place ending in -where</h3>
		<p>Adverbs of place that end in -where express the idea of location without specifying a specific location or direction.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>

				<li>Is there <strong>anywhere</strong> I can find a perfect plate of spaghetti around here?</li>

				<li>We will keep walking <strong>homewards</strong> until we arrive.</li>

		<p>Be careful: <em>Towards</em> is a preposition, not an adverb, so it is always followed by a noun or a pronoun.</p>
