		<h3>Reading decimals</h3>
		<p>Read decimals aloud in English by pronouncing the decimal point as "point", then read each digit individually. Money is not read this way.</p>

		<h3>Reading fractions</h3>
		<p>Read fractions using the cardinal number for the numerator and the ordinal number for the denominator, making the ordinal number plural if the numerator is larger than 1. This applies to all numbers except for the number 2, which is read "half" when it is the denominator, and "halves" if there is more than one.</p>

		<h3>Pronouncing percentages</h3>
		<p>Percentages are easy to read aloud in English. Just say the number and then add the word "percent".</p>

		<h3>Reading sums of money</h3>
		<p>To read a sum of money, first read the whole number, then add the currency name. If there is a decimal, follow with the decimal pronounced as a whole number, and if coinage has a name in the currency, add that word at the end. Note that normal decimals are not read in this way. These rules only apply to currency.</p>

		<h3>Pronouncing Years</h3>
		<p>Reading years in English is relatively complicated. In general, when the year is a four digit number, read the first two digits as a whole number, then the second two digits as another whole number. There are a few exceptions to this rule. Years that are within the first 100 years of a new millenium can be read as whole numbers even though they have four digits, or they can be read as two two-digit numbers. Millennia are always read as whole numbers because they would be difficult to pronounce otherwise. New centuries are read as whole numbers of hundreds. We do not use the word "thousand", at least not for reading years within the past 1000 years.</p>
		<p>Years that have just three digits can be read as a three digit number, or as a one digit number followed by a two-digit number. Years that are a two digit number are read as a whole number. You can precede any year by the words "the year" to make your meaning clear, and this is common for two and three digit years. Years before the year 0 are followed by BC, pronounced as two letters of the alphabet.</p>
		<p>Interestingly, these rules apply to reading street addresses as well.</p>

		<h3>How to say 0</h3>
		<p>There are several ways to pronounce the number 0, used in different contexts. Unfortunately, usage varies between different English-speaking countries. These pronunciations apply to American English.</p>
