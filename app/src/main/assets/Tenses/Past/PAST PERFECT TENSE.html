		<h3>Functions of the past perfect</h3>
		<p>The past perfect refers to a time <strong>earlier than before now</strong>. It is used to make it clear that <strong>one event happened before another</strong> in the past. It does not matter which event is mentioned first - the tense makes it clear which one happened first.</p>
		<p>In these examples, Event A is the event that happened first and Event B is the second or more recent event:</p>
		<table>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Event A</strong></td>
					<td><strong>Event B</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>John <strong>had gone</strong> out</td>
					<td>when I arrived in the office.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Event A</strong></td>
					<td><strong>Event B</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I <strong>had saved</strong> my document</td>
					<td>before the computer crashed.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Event B</strong></td>
					<td><strong>Event A</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>When they arrived</td>
					<td>we <strong>had already started</strong> cooking.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Event B</strong></td>
					<td><strong>Event A</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>He was very tired</td>
					<td>because he <strong>hadn't slept</strong> well.</td>
				</tr>
