		<h3>Forming the present continuous</h3>
		<p>The present continuous of any verb is composed of two parts - <em>the present tense of the verb to be + the present participle of the main verb.</em></p>
		<p>(The form of the present participle is: <em>base+ing, e.g. talking, playing, moving, smiling)</em></p>

		<h3>Functions of the present continuous</h3>
		<p>As with all tenses in English, the <strong><em>speaker's attitude</em></strong> is as important as the time of the action or event. When someone uses the present continuous, they are thinking about something that is <em><strong>unfinished or incomplete</strong></em></p>
		<h5>The present continuous is used:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>to describe an action that is going on at this moment: <em><strong>You are using</strong> the Internet</em>. <em><strong>You are studying</strong> English grammar.</em></li>
			<li>to describe an action that is going on during this period of time or a trend: <em><strong>Are you still working</strong> for the same company? More and more people <strong>are becoming</strong> vegetarian.</em></li>
			<li>to describe an action or event in the future, which has already been planned or prepared: <em><strong>We're going</strong> on holiday tomorrow</em>. <em><strong>I'm meeting</strong> my boyfriend tonight</em>. <em><strong>Are they visiting</strong></em> you next winter?</li>
			<li>to describe a temporary event or situation: <em>He usually plays the drums, but <strong>he's playing</strong> bass guitar tonight</em>. <em>The weather forecast was good, but <strong>it's raining</strong> at the moment.</em></li>
			<li>with "always, forever, constantly", to describe and emphasise a continuing series of repeated actions: <em>Harry and Sally <strong>are always arguing</strong>! <strong>You're constantly complaining</strong> about your mother-in-law!</em></li>
		</ul>
