<p>This <em>looks </em>exactly the same as a present participle, and for this reason it is now common to call both forms <em>'the <strong>-ing form' </strong>. </em>However it is useful to understand the difference between the two. The gerund always has the same function as a noun (although it looks like a verb), so it can be used: </p>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">as the subject of the sentence: </font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Eating </strong></em><em>people is wrong. </em></li>
  <li><em><strong>Hunting </strong>tigers is dangerous. </em></li>
  <li><em><strong>Flying </strong></em><em>makes me nervous. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">as the complement of the verb <em>'to be' </em>: </font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>One of his duties is </em><em><strong>attending </strong>meetings. </em></li>
  <li><em>The hardest thing about <strong>learning </strong>English is understanding the gerund. </em></li>
  <li><em>One of life's pleasures is <strong>having </strong>breakfast in bed. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" color="Purple"><strong> after prepositions. </strong><strong>The gerund <em>must </em>be used when a verb comes after a preposition: </strong></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Can you sneeze without </em><em><strong>opening </strong>your mouth? </em></li>
  <li><em>She is good at <strong>painting </strong>. </em></li>
  <li><em>They're keen on <strong>windsurfing </strong>. </em></li>
  <li><em>She avoided him by <strong>walking </strong>on the opposite side of the road. </em></li>
  <li><em>We arrived in Madrid after <strong>driving </strong>all night. </em></li>
  <li><em>My father decided against <strong>postponing </strong>his trip to Hungary. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is also true of certain expressions ending in a preposition, e.g. <em>in spite of, there's no point in..: </em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>There's no point in </em><em><strong>waiting </strong>. </em></li>
  <li><em>In spite of <strong>missing </strong>the train, we arrived on time. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> <font size="3" color="Purple">after a number of <em>'phrasal verbs' </em>which are composed of a verb + preposition/adverb </font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple"><em>Example:</em></font> </strong><em><br>
to look forward to, to give up, to be for/against, to take to, to put off, to keep on: </em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>I look forward to <strong>hearing </strong>from you soon. ( at the end of a letter) </em></li>
  <li><em>When are you going to give up <strong>smoking </strong>? </em></li>
  <li><em>She always puts off <strong>goi ng </strong>to the dentist. </em></li>
  <li><em>He kept on <strong>asking </strong>for money. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">NOTE: </font></strong>There are some phrasal verbs and other expressions that include the word <strong><em>'to' </em></strong>as a preposition, <strong><em>not </em></strong>as part of a <em>to-infinitive </em>: - <em>to look forward to, to take to, to be accustomed to, to be used to. </em>It is important to recognise that <strong><em>'to' </em></strong>is a preposition in these cases, as it must be followed by a gerund: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>We are looking forward <strong>to </strong></em><strong><em>seeing </em></strong><em>you. </em></li>
  <li><em>I am used <strong>to </strong><strong>waiting </strong>for buses. </em></li>
  <li><em>She didn't really take <strong>to </strong><strong>studying </strong>English. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to check whether <strong><em>'to? </em></strong>is a preposition or part of a <em>to-infinitive </em>: if you can put a noun or the pronoun <em>'it' </em>after it, then it is a preposition and must be followed by a gerund: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>I am accustomed <strong>to it </strong>(the cold). </em></li>
  <li><em>I am accustomed <strong>to </strong></em><strong><em>being </em></strong><em>cold. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple"> in compound nouns<br>
</font></strong><font size="3" color="Purple"><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></font> </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>a <strong>driving </strong>lesson, a <strong>swimming </strong>pool, bird- <strong>watching </strong>, train- <strong>spotting </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that the meaning is that of a noun, not of a continuous verb. </p>
<h3><font size="3" color="Purple"><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></font> </h3>
<ul>
  <li>the pool is not swimming, it is a <em>pool for swimming in </em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong> <font size="3" color="Purple">after the expressions:</font> </strong></p>
<p><em>can't help, can't stand, it's no use/good, </em>and the adjective <em>worth: </em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>She couldn't help </em><em><strong>falling </strong>in love with him. </em></li>
  <li><em>I can't stand <strong>being </strong>stuck in traffic jams. </em></li>
  <li><em>It's no use/good <strong>trying </strong>to escape. </em></li>
  <li><em>It might be worth <strong>phoning </strong>the station to check the time of the train. </em></li>
</ul>
