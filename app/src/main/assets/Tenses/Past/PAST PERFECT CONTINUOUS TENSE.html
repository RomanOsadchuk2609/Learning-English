		<h3>Functions of the past perfect continuous</h3>
		<p>The past perfect continuous corresponds to the present perfect continuous, but with reference to a time earlier than 'before now'. As with the present perfect continuous, we are more interested in the <strong>process</strong>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Had you been waiting</strong> long before the taxi arrived?</li>
				<li><strong>We had been trying</strong> to open the door for five minutes when Jane found her key.</li>
				<li><strong>It had been raining</strong> hard for several hours and the streets were very wet.</li>
				<li>Her friends <strong>had been thinking</strong> of calling the police when she walked in.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>This form is also used in <strong>reported speech</strong>. It is the equivalent of the past continuous and the present perfect continuous in direct speech:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Jane said, "I have been gardening all afternoon." = Jane said <strong>she had been gardening</strong> all afternoon.</li>
			<li>When the police questioned him, John said, "I was working late in the office that night." = When the police questioned him, John told them <strong>he had been working</strong> late in the office that night.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Forming the past perfect continuous</h3>
		<p>The past perfect continuous is composed of two elements - the past perfect of the verb <em>to be (=had been)</em> + the present participle <em>(base+ing)</em>.</p>
