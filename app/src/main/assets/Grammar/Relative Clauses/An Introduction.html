<p>There are two different types of relative clause: </p>
<ol>
  <li>A <strong>"defining" </strong>or identifying clause, which tells us which person or thing we are talking about. This kind of clause could often be information included in brackets (...) </li>
  <li>A <strong>"non-defining" </strong>or non-essential clause, which gives us more information about the person or thing we are talking about. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Examples </h3>
<ul>
  <li>The farmer ( his name was Fred ) sold us some potatoes. <img src="An Introduction_ARROW1.gif" width="24" height="5">The farmer, whose name was Fred , sold us some potatoes. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to see the difference between the two types of clause, as it affects: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the choice of pronoun used to introduce the clause, </li>
  <li>the punctuation - you must use commas with a non-defining clause. </li>
</ul>
