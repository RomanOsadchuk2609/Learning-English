	<h1 class="page-title">Type 3 Conditional</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<h3>Form</h3>
		<p>In a Type 3 conditional sentence, the tense in the 'if' clause is the past perfect, and the tense in the main clause is the perfect conditional or the <b>perfect continuous conditional</b>.</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>If clause (condition)</th>
					<th>Main clause (result)</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>If + past perfect</strong></td>
					<td><strong>perfect conditional or perfect continuous conditional</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>If this thing had happened</td>
					<td>that thing would have happened.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. You may have to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation when you change the order of the clauses, but the meaning is identical.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>If it had rained, you would have gotten wet.</li>
				<li>You would have gotten wet if it had rained.</li>
				<li>You would have passed your exam if you had worked harder.</li>
				<li>If you had worked harder, you would have passed your exam.</li>
				<li>I would have believed you if you hadn't lied to me before.</li>
				<li>If you hadn't lied to me before, I would have believed you.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Function</h3>
		<p>The type 3 conditional refers to an impossible condition in the past and its probable result in the past. These sentences are truly hypothetical and unreal, because it is now too late for the condition or its result to exist. There is always some implication of regret with type 3 conditional sentences. The reality is the opposite of, or contrary to, what the sentence expresses. In type 3 conditional sentences, the time is the <strong>past</strong> and the situation is <strong>hypothetical</strong>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>If I had worked harder I would have passed the exam. (But I didn't work hard, and I didn't pass the exam.)</li>
				<li>If I had known you were coming I would have baked a cake. (But I didn't know and I didn't bake a cake.)</li>
				<li>I would have been happy if you had called me on my birthday. (But you didn't call me and I am not happy.)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>In type 3 conditional sentences, you can also use modals in the main clause instead of "would" to express the degree of certainty, permission, or a recommendation about the outcome.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>If I had worked harder I might have passed the exam.</li>
				<li>You could have been on time if you had caught the bus.</li>
				<li>If he called you, you could go.</li>
				<li>If you bought my school supplies for me, I might be able to go to the park.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Contractions</h4>
		<p>Both <em>would</em> and <em>had</em> can be contracted to <em>'d</em>, which can be confusing if you are not confident with type 3 conditional sentences. Remember 2 rules:<br>
		1. <strong><em>would</em> never appears in the if-clause</strong> so if <em>'d</em> appears in the if clause, it must be abbreviating <em>had</em>.<br>
		2. <strong><em>had</em> never appears before <em>have</em></strong> so if <em>'d</em> appears on a pronoun just before <em>have</em>, it must be abbreviating <em>would</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>If <strong>I'd</strong> known you were in hospital, <strong>I'd</strong> have visited you.</li>
				<li>If <strong>I had</strong> known you were in hospital, <strong>I would</strong> have visited you.</li>
				<li><strong>I'd</strong> have bought you a present if <strong>I'd</strong> known it was your birthday.</li>
				<li><strong>I would</strong> have bought you a present if <strong>I had</strong> known it was your birthday.</li>
				<li>If <strong>you'd</strong> given me your e-mail, <strong>I'd</strong> have written to you.</li>
				<li>If <strong>you had</strong> given me your e-mail, <strong>I would</strong> have written to you.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>The perfect conditional tense</h3>
		<p>The perfect conditional of any verb is composed of three elements:<br>
		<strong>would + have + past participle</strong><br>
		<em>Have</em> followed by the past participle is used in other constructions as well. it is called the "perfect infinitive".</p>
