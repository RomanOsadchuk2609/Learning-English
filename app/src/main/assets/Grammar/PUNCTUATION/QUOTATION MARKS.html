	<div class="content">
		<p>Use quotation marks to cite something someone said exactly. When rephrasing what someone told you, no quotation marks are needed.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>"I'm going to the store now," she said.</li>
				<li>Harry told me, "Don't forget your soccer jersey."</li>
				<li>Harry told me not to forget my soccer jersey.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>If quoting others within a quote, both single and double quotation marks are used to set the two separate quotations off from each other.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Example</h5>
			<p>'I haven't spoken to Peter for months,' Dianne said.'The last time I spoke to him he said, "I'm going to Bahrain and won't be back for about three years", I've heard nothing since then'.</p>
		</div>
		<p>You may see single or double quotation marks used to mark out idiomatic or unfamiliar expressions</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I've always thought that he was very annoying, a bit of a 'pain in the neck.'</li>
				<li>I'm not sure what you mean by "custodial care", but I'm sure you will explain it to me.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Quotation marks both single and double are also used for specific purposes in bibliographic references or when citing sources in academic writing. There are a number of ways of organising bibliographies which set out standard formats. Most organisations and academic institutions will prefer one of these or have their own format published in a 'style guide'.</p>
