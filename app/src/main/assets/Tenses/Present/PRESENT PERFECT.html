		<h3>Definition of the present perfect tense</h3>
		<p>The present perfect is used to indicate a link between the present and the past. The time of the action is <strong>before now but not specified</strong>, and we are often more interested in the <strong>result</strong> than in the action itself.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-danger">
			<strong>BE CAREFUL!</strong> There may be a verb tense in your language with a similar form, but the meaning is probably NOT the same.
		</div>
		<h4>The Present Perfect is used to describe</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>An action or situation that started in the past and continues in the present. <em>I <strong>have lived</strong> in Bristol since 1984</em> (= and I still do.)</li>
			<li>An action performed during a period that has not yet finished. <em>She <strong>has been</strong> to the cinema twice this week</em> (= and the week isn't over yet.)</li>
			<li>A repeated action in an unspecified period between the past and now. <em>We <strong>have visited</strong> Portugal several times.</em></li>
			<li>An action that was completed in the very recent past, expressed by 'just'. <em>I <strong>have just finished</strong> my work.</em></li>
			<li>An action when the time is not important. <em>He <strong>has read</strong> 'War and Peace'.</em> (= the result of his reading is important)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Forming the Present Perfect</h3>
		<p>The present perfect of any verb is composed of two elements : the appropriate form of the auxiliary verb <strong><em>to have</em></strong> (present tense), plus the past participle of the main verb. The past participle of a regular verb is <strong><em>base</em>+ed</strong>, e.g. <em>played, arrived, looked</em>. For irregular verbs, see the <strong>Table of irregular verbs</strong> in the section called <strong>'Verbs'</strong>.</p>
