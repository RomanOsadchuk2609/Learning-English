	<h1 class="page-title">Forming the possessive</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The possessive form is used with nouns referring to people, groups of people, countries, and animals. It shows a relationship of belonging between one thing and another. To form the possessive, add apostrophe + s to the noun. If the noun is plural, or already ends in s, just add an apostrophe after the s.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>the car of John = <strong>John's car</strong></li>
				<li>the room of the girls = <strong>the girls' room</strong></li>
				<li>clothes for men = <strong>men's clothes</strong></li>
				<li>the boat of the sailors = <strong>the sailors' boat</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>For names ending in s, you can either add an apostrophe + s, or just an apostrophe. The first option is more common. When pronouncing a possessive name, we add the sound /z/ to the end of the name.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Thomas's book (or Thomas' book)</li>
