		<h3>Functions</h3>
		<p>The future continuous refers to an unfinished action or event that will be in progress at a time later than now. The future continuous is used for quite a few different purposes.</p>
		<p>The future continuous can be used to project ourselves into the future.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>This time next week <strong>I will be sun-bathing</strong> in Bali.</li>
				<li>By Christmas <strong>I will be skiing</strong> like a pro.</li>
				<li>Just think, next Monday <strong>you will be working</strong> in your new job.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>The future continuous can be used for predicting or guessing about future events.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>He'll be coming</strong> to the meeting, I expect.</li>
				<li>I guess <strong>you'll be feeling</strong> thirsty after working in the sun.</li>
				<li><strong>You'll be missing</strong> the sunshine once you're back in England.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>In the interrogative form, the future continuous can be used to ask politely for information about the future.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Will you be bringing</strong> your friend to the pub tonight?</li>
				<li><strong>Will Jim be coming</strong> with us?</li>
				<li><strong>Will she be going</strong> to the party tonight?</li>
				<li><strong>Will I be sleeping</strong> in this room?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>The future continuous can be used to refer to continuous events that we expect to happen in the future.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I'll be seeing Jim at the conference next week.</li>
				<li>When he is in Australia <strong>he will be staying</strong> with friends.</li>
				<li><strong>I'll be eating</strong> with Jane this evening so I can tell her.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>When combined with <em>still</em>, the future continuous refers to events that are already happening now and that we expect to continue some time into the future.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>In an hour <strong>I'll still be ironing</strong> my clothes.</li>
				<li>Tomorrow <strong>he'll still be suffering</strong> from his cold.</li>
				<li>Next year <strong>will she still be wearing</strong> a size six?</li>
				<li><strong>Won't stock prices still be falling</strong> in the morning?</li>
				<li>Unfortunately, <strong>sea levels will still be rising</strong> in 20 years.</li>
			</ul>
