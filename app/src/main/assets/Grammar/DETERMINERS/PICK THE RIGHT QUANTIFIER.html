		<h4>Using "Much" and"Many"</h4>
		<p><em>Much</em> and <em>many</em> are mainly used in interrogative and negative sentences. They are also used in affirmative and negative sentences in combination with <em>too</em> and <em>so</em>. Notice: the word <em>many</em> can be used alone in affirmative sentences while the word <em>much</em> cannot. <em>Much</em> is replaced in affirmative sentences with <em>a lot of</em> or <em>lots of</em> (these expressions can also replace <em>many</em>).</p>
