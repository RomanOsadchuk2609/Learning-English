		<h3>Notes on the simple present, third person singular</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In the third person singular the verb <b>always ends in -s</b>:<br>
			<em>he want<b>s</b>, she need<b>s</b>, he give<b>s</b>, she think<b>s.</b></em></li>
			<li>Negative and question forms use DOES (= the third person of the auxiliary 'DO') + the infinitive of the verb.<br>
			<em>He want<b>s</b> ice cream. <b>Does</b> he want strawberry? He <b>does</b> not want vanilla.</em></li>
			<li>Verbs ending in <b>-y</b> : the third person changes the <b>-y</b> to <b>-ies</b>:<br>
			<em>fly --&gt; fl<b>ies</b>, cry --&gt; cr<b>ies</b></em><br>
			<b>Exception</b>: if there is a vowel before the -<b>y</b>:<br>
			<em>play --&gt; play<b>s</b>, pray --&gt; pray<b>s</b></em></li>
			<li>Add <b>-es</b> to verbs ending in:<b>-ss, -x, -sh, -ch</b>:<br>
			<em>he pass<b>es,</b> she catch<b>es,</b> he fix<b>es,</b> it push<b>es</b></em></li>
		</ul>
