	<div class="content">
		<p>The exclamation mark is used to express exasperation, astonishment, or surprise, or to emphasise a comment or short, sharp phrase. In professional or everyday writing, exclamation marks are used sparingly if at all.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Help! Help!</li>
				<li>That's unbelievable!</li>
				<li>Get out!</li>
				<li>Look out!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>You can also use exclamation marks to mark a phrase as humourous, ironic or sarcastic.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>What a lovely day! (when it obviously is not a lovely day)</li>
				<li>That was clever! (when someone has done something stupid)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>In very informal writing styles (SMS, chat, Twitter or Facebook, etc.), an exclamation mark is sometimes combined with a question mark to indicate both surprise and slight uncertainty. Double and triple exclamation marks are common in very informal writing styles, but are a sign of being uneducated in less casual correspondance.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples of casual writing</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He's getting married!?</li>
				<li>That's insane!!!</li>
			</ul>
