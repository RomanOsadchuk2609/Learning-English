	<h1 class="page-title">Gerund</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The gerund looks exactly the same as a present participle, but it is useful to understand the difference between the two. The gerund always has the same function as a noun (although it looks like a verb). Some uses of the gerund are covered on this page. A separate page deals with <b>verbs that are followed by the gerund</b>.</p>
		<h4>The gerund as the subject of the sentence</h4>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Eating</strong> people is wrong.</li>
				<li><strong>Hunting</strong> tigers is dangerous.</li>
				<li><strong>Flying</strong> makes me nervous.</li>
				<li><strong>Brushing</strong> your teeth is important.</li>
				<li><strong>Smoking</strong> causes lung cancer.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The gerund as the complement of the verb 'to be'</h4>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>One of his duties <strong>is attending</strong> meetings.</li>
				<li>The hardest thing about learning English <strong>is understanding</strong> the gerund.</li>
				<li>One of life's pleasures <strong>is having</strong> breakfast in bed.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The gerund after prepositions</h4>
		<p>The gerund must be used when a verb comes after a preposition. This is also true of certain expressions ending in a preposition, for example the expressions <em>in spite of</em> &amp; <em>there's no point in</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Can you sneeze <strong>without opening</strong> your mouth?</li>
				<li>She is good <strong>at painting</strong>.</li>
				<li>She avoided him <strong>by walking</strong> on the opposite side of the road.</li>
				<li>We arrived in Madrid <strong>after driving</strong> all night.</li>
				<li>My father decided <strong>against postponing</strong> his trip to Hungary.</li>
				<li>There's no point <strong>in waiting</strong>.</li>
				<li>In spite <strong>of missing</strong> the train, we arrived on time.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The gerund after phrasal verbs</h4>
		<p>Phrasal verbs are composed of <strong>a verb + preposition or adverb</strong>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>When will you <strong>give up smoking</strong>?</li>
				<li>She always <strong>puts off going</strong> to the dentist.</li>
				<li>He <strong>kept on asking</strong> for money.</li>
				<li>Jim <strong>ended up buying</strong> a new TV after his old one broke.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>There are some phrasal verbs that include the word "to" as a preposition for example <em>to look forward to, to take to, to be accustomed to, to get around to, &amp; to be used to</em>. It is important to recognise that the word "to" is a preposition in these cases because it must be followed by a gerund. It is not part of the infinitive form of the verb. You can check whether "to" is a preposition or part of the infinitive. If you can put the pronoun "it" after the word "to" and form a meaningful sentence, then the word "to" is a preposition and must be followed by a gerund.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I <strong>look forward to hearing</strong> from you soon.</li>
				<li>I <strong>look forward to it</strong>.</li>
				<li>I am <strong>used to waiting</strong> for buses.</li>
				<li>I am <strong>used to it</strong>.</li>
				<li>She didn't really <strong>take to studying</strong> English.</li>
				<li>She didn't really <strong>take to it</strong>.</li>
				<li>When will you <strong>get around to mowing</strong> the grass?</li>
				<li>When will you <strong>get around to it</strong>?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The gerund in compound nouns</h4>
		<p>In compound nouns using the gerund, it is clear that the meaning is that of a noun, not of a continuous verb. For example, with the word "swimming pool" it is a pool for swimming in, it is not a pool that is swimming.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I am giving Sally a <strong>driving lesson</strong>.</li>
				<li>They have a <strong>swimming pool</strong> in their back yard.</li>
				<li>I bought some new <strong>running shoes</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The gerund after some expressions</h4>
		<p>The gerund is necessary after the expressions <em>can't help, can't stand, to be worth, &amp; it's no use</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>She <strong>couldn't help falling</strong> in love with him.</li>
				<li>I <strong>can't stand being</strong> stuck in traffic jams.</li>
				<li>It's <strong>no use trying</strong> to escape.</li>
				<li>It might <strong>be worth phoning</strong> the station to check the time of the train.</li>
			</ul>
