	<div class="content">
		<p>To compare two things that are unequal, we use the pattern:</p>
		<p><strong><em>adjective indicating quantity</em> + <em>(noun)</em> + than</strong></p>
		<p>The quantity adjective you use depends if the noun in the comparison is countable or uncountable.</p>
		<h4>Countable nouns</h4>
		<p>Use <em>more</em> and <em>fewer</em> with countable nouns. Note that the noun may be ommitted when it is understood from the context, as in the last example below.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>They have <strong>more children than</strong> we do.</li>
				<li>We have <strong>more customers than</strong> they do.</li>
				<li>Tom has <strong>fewer books than</strong> Jane.</li>
				<li>There are <strong>fewer houses in his village than</strong> in mine.</li>
				<li>You know <strong>more people than</strong> I do.</li>
				<li>I have visited the States <strong>more times than</strong> he has.</li>
				<li>I have three brothers. That's <strong>more than</strong> you have. ("brothers" is understood)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Uncountable nouns</h4>
		<p>Use <em>more</em> or <em>less</em> with uncountable nouns. Note that the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context, as in the last example below.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>John eats <strong>more food than</strong> Peter.</li>
				<li>Jim has <strong>less patience than</strong> Sam.</li>
				<li>You've heard <strong>more news than</strong> I have.</li>
				<li>He's had <strong>more success than</strong> his brother has.</li>
				<li>They've got <strong>less water than</strong> we have.</li>
