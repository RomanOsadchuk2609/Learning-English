<p>As the name suggests, these clauses give essential information to define or identify the person or thing we are talking about. Obviously, this is only necessary if there is more than one person or thing involved. </p>
<h3>Example </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dogs that like cats are very unusual. </li>
</ul>
<p>In this sentence we understand that there are many dogs, but it is clear that we are only talking about the ones <em>that like cats. </em></p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Who, whom </em>and <em>which </em>can be replaced by <em>that. </em>This is very common in spoken English. </li>
