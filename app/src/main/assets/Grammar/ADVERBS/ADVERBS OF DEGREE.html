	<div class="content">
		<p>Adverbs of degree tell us about the <b>intensity</b> of something. Adverbs of degree are usually placed <b>before</b> the adjective, adverb, or verb that they modify, although there are some exceptions. The words "too", "enough", "very", and "extremely" are examples of adverbs of degree.</p>

		<h3>Usage of "enough"</h3>
		<p>Enough can be used as both an adverb and as a determiner.</p>
		<h4>Enough as an adverb</h4>
		<p>Enough as an adverb meaning 'to the necessary degree' goes after the adjective or adverb that it is modifying, and not before it as other adverbs do. It can be used both in positive and negative sentences.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Is your coffee <strong>hot enough</strong>?</li>
				<li>This box isn't <strong>big enough</strong>.</li>
				<li>He didn't work <strong>hard enough</strong>.</li>
				<li>I got here <strong>early enough</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Enough is often followed by "to" + the infinitive.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He didn't work hard enough <strong>to pass the exam</strong>.</li>

				<li>She's not experienced enough <strong>for this job</strong>.</li>
				<li>Is the coffee hot enough <strong>for you</strong>?</li>
				<li class="">He didn't work hard enough <strong>for a promotion</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Enough as a determiner</h4>
		<p>Enough as a determiner meaning 'as much/many as necessary' goes before the noun it modifies. It is used with countable nouns in the plural and with uncountable nouns.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>We have <strong>enough bread</strong>.</li>
				<li>You have <strong>enough children</strong>.</li>
				<li>They don't have <strong>enough food</strong>.</li>
				<li>I don't have <strong>enough apples</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Usage of "too"</h3>
		<p>"Too" is always an adverb, but it has two distinct meanings, each with its own usage patterns.</p>
		<h4>Too meaning "also"</h4>
		<p>Too as an adverb meaning "also" goes at the end of the phrase it modifies.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I would like to go swimming <strong>too</strong>, if you will let me come.</li>
				<li>Can I go to the zoo <strong>too</strong>?</li>
				<li>Is this gift for me <strong>too</strong>?</li>
				<li>I'm not going to clean your room <strong>too</strong>!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Too meaning "excessively"</h4>
		<p>Too as an adverb meaning "excessively" goes before the adjective or adverb it modifies. It can be used in both affirmative and negative sentences.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>This coffee is <strong>too hot</strong>.</li>
				<li>He works <strong>too hard</strong>.</li>
				<li>Isn't she <strong>too young</strong>?</li>
				<li>I am not <strong>too short</strong>!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Too is often followed by "to" + the infinitive.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The coffee was too hot <strong>to drink</strong>.</li>
				<li>You're too young <strong>to have grandchildren</strong>!</li>
				<li>I am not too tired <strong>to go out tonight</strong>.</li>
				<li>Don't you work too hard <strong>to have any free time</strong>?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Too can also be followed by "for someone" or "for something".</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The coffee was too hot <strong>for me</strong>.</li>
				<li>The dress was too small <strong>for her</strong>.</li>
				<li>He's not too old <strong>for this job</strong>.</li>
				<li>Sally's not too slow <strong>for our team</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Usage of "very"</h3>
		<p>Very goes before an adverb or adjective to make it stronger.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The girl was very beautiful.</li>
				<li>The house is very expensive.</li>
				<li>He worked very quickly.</li>
				<li>She runs very fast.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>If we want to make a negative form of an adjective or adverb, we can add "not" to the verb, we can use an adjective or adverb of opposite meaning, or we can use "not very" with the original adjective or adverb. The meanings of the phrases are not identical. Usually the phrase using "not very" is less direct, and thus more polite, than the other phrases.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Original phrase</th>
						<th>Opposite meaning with "not"</th>
						<th>Opposite meaning with "not very"</th>
						<th>Opposite meaning with an opposite word</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>

						<td>The girl was not beautiful.</td>
						<td>The girl was not very beautiful.</td>
						<td>The girl was ugly.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>He worked quickly.</td>
						<td>He did not work quickly.</td>

		<h4>Difference in meaning between "very" and "too"</h4>
		<p>There is a big difference in meaning between "too" and "very". "Very" expresses a fact while "too" suggests there is a problem.</p>

				<li>He speaks <strong>too quickly</strong> for me to understand.</li>

			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Other adverbs used like "very"</h4>
		<p>Some common adverbs are used in the same way as "very" to heighten the degree of adjectives and adverbs.</p>

		<h3>Inversion with negative adverbs</h3>
		<p>Normally the subject goes before the verb, however, some negative adverbs can cause an inversion when placed at the beginning of the clause. The order is reversed and the verb goes before the subject. This inversion is only used in writing, not in speaking.</p>
