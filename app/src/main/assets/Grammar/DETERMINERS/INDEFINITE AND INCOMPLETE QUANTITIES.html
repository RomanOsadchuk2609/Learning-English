	<div class="content">
		<p><em>Some</em> and <em>any</em> can be used with countable and uncountable nouns to describe an undefined or incomplete quantity.</p>
		<h3>Using "some"</h3>
		<p><em>Some</em> can be used in descriptive sentences.</p>

				<li>Philip wants <strong>some</strong> help with his exams.</li>
				<li>There is <strong>some</strong> butter in the fridge.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>Some</em> is also used in interrogative sentences when you think you already know the answer.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>

				<li>Will you have <strong>some</strong> roast beef? = Probably you will</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>Some</em> can also be used in interrogative sentences to ask for something or to offer something.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Could I have <strong>some</strong> books, please?</li>
				<li>Why don't you take <strong>some</strong> apples home with you?</li>
				<li>Would you like <strong>some</strong> tea?</li>
				<li>Will you have <strong>some</strong> cake?</li>

		</div>
		<h3>Using "any"</h3>
		<p><em>Any</em>is used in interrogative sentences when you do not know the answer.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>

				<li>Are there <strong>any</strong> problems with your work?</li>
			</ul>
