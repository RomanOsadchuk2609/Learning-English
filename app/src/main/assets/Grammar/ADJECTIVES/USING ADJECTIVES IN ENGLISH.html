	<div class="content">
		<p>Adjectives in English are invariable. They do not change their form depending on the gender or number of the noun.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>This is a <strong>hot</strong> potato.</li>
				<li>Those are some <strong>hot</strong> potatoes.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>To emphasise or strengthen the meaning of an adjective, use the adverbs <em>very</em> or <em>really</em> in front of the adjective you want to strengthen.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>This is a <strong>very hot</strong> potato</li>
				<li>Those are some <strong>really hot</strong> potatoes.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Adjectives in English usually appear in front of the noun that they modify.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>beautiful</strong> girl ignored me.</li>
				<li>The <strong>fast red</strong> car drove away.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Adjectives can also appear after being and sensing verbs like <em>to be</em>, <em>to seem</em> , <em>to look</em> &amp; <em>to taste</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Italy is <strong>beautiful</strong>.</li>
				<li>I don't think she seems <strong>nice</strong> at all.</li>
				<li>You look <strong>tired</strong>.</li>
				<li>This meat tastes <strong>funny</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Some exceptions</h3>
		<p>Adjectives appear after the noun in some fixed expressions.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>Princess Royal</strong> is visiting Oxford today.</li>
				<li>The <strong>President elect</strong> made a speech last night.</li>
				<li>He received a <strong>court martial</strong> the following week.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>The adjectives <em>involved</em>, <em>present</em> &amp; <em>concerned</em> can appear either before or after the noun that they modify, but with a different meaning depending on the placement.</p>
