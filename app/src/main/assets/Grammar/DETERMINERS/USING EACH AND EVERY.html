	<div class="content">
		<p><em>Each</em> is a way of seeing the members of a group as individuals, while <em>every</em> is a way of seeing a group as a series of members. These distributives can only be used with countable nouns. They are normally used with singular nouns, and are placed before the noun. In many cases, they are interchangeable.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Each child</strong> received a present.</li>
				<li><strong>Every child</strong> received a present.</li>
				<li>I gave <strong>each plant</strong> some water.</li>
				<li>I gave <strong>every plant</strong> some water.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>Each</em> can also be used with plural nouns and pronouns but must be followed by 'of'. <em>Every</em> cannot be used with plural nouns.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">

				<li><strong>Each of the children</strong> received a present.</li>
				<li>I gave <strong>each of the plants</strong> some water.</li>
				<li>He told <strong>each of us</strong> our jobs.</li>
				<li>I gave <strong>each of them</strong> a kiss.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>Every</em> can express different points in a series, especially with time expressions. <em>Each</em> works in the same way, but is less common.</p>
