	<h1 class="page-title">Perfect continuous infinitive</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The perfect continuous infinitive is used to express a continuing but now completed action after a verb which must be followed by the infinitive. The perfect infinitive is formed:<br>
		<strong>to have been + present participle</strong></p>
		<p>As with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form of the perfect continuous infinitive is required, so the word <em>to</em> is omitted. This happens after most modal auxiliaries, and in other places where zero infinitives are used.</p>

				<li>You must <strong>have been waiting</strong> for hours!</li>
				<li>They might <strong>have been talking</strong> before you came in.</li>
