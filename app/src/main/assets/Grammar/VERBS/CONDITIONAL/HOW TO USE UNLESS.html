	<div class="content">
		<p><em>Unless</em> means the same as <em>if...not</em>. Like <em>if</em>, <em>unless</em> is followed by a present tense, a past tense, or a past perfect tense (never by a conditional). <em>Unless</em> is used instead of <em>if...not</em> in conditional sentences of all types. The order of the clauses doesn't matter with sentences using <em>unless</em>.</p>
