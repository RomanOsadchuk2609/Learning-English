<h3><font size="3" color="Purple">The Gerund and the Present Participle: 'ING' Form </font></h3>
<p>The '-ing' form of the verb may be a present participle or a gerund.<br>
The form is identical, the difference is in the function, or the job the word does in the sentence. </p>
<h3><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">The present participle </font></strong>: </h3>
<p>This is most commonly used: </p>
<ul>
  <li>as part of the continuous form of a verb, <br>
      <em>he is <strong>painting </strong>; she has been <strong>waiting </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>after verbs of movement/position in the pattern: <br>
    verb + present participle <em>, <br>
    She sat <strong>looking </strong>at the sea </em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>after verbs of perception in the pattern: <br>
    verb + object + present participle <em>, <br>
    We saw him <strong>swimming </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>as an adjective, e.g. <em><strong>amazing </strong>, <strong>worrying </strong>, <strong>exciting </strong>, <strong>boring </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">The gerund</font> </strong>: </h3>
<p>This always has the same function as a noun (although it looks like a verb), so it can be used: </p>
<ul>
  <li>as the subject of the sentence: <br>
      <em><strong>Eating </strong>people is wrong. </em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>after prepositions: <br>
      <em>Can you sneeze without <strong>opening </strong>your mouth? <br>
    She is good at <strong>painting </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>after certain verbs, <br>
    e.g. <em><strong>like </strong>, <strong>hate </strong>, <strong>admit </strong>, <strong>imagine </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>in compound nouns, <br>
    e.g. <em>a <strong>driving </strong>lesson, a <strong>swimming </strong>pool, bird- <strong>watching </strong>, train- <strong>spotting </strong></em></li>
</ul>
