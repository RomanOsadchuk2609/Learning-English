	<div class="content">
		<p>Pre-determiners are normally placed before an <strong>indefinite article + adjective + noun</strong> to express an opinion about the noun they modify. <em>Such</em> and <em>what</em> are used to express surprise or other emotions.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>What a lovely day</strong>!</li>
				<li>She's <strong>such a beautiful woman</strong>.</li>
				<li>You can't imagine <strong>what an incredible meal</strong> I just ate.</li>
				<li>I've had <strong>such a good time</strong> today!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>Rather</em> and <em>quite</em> are commenting words, referring to the degree of a particular quality as expressed by the adjective that modifies the noun. They can express disappointment, pleasure, or other emotions depending on the adjective in question. In British English, <em>rather</em> is used as a pre-determiner. In American English it is only used as an adverb. The examples given below are British English.</p>
