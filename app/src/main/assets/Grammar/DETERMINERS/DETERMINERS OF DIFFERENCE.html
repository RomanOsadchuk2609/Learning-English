	<h1 class="page-title">Determiners of difference</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The determiners <em>other</em> and <em>another</em> refer to something different, remaining, or additional. They are placed before a noun. <em>The other</em> is treated separately because its usage is slightly different.</p>
		<table>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Other</td>
					<td>Plural countable nouns and all uncountable nouns</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Another</td>
					<td>Singular countable nouns</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The other</td>
					<td>Any noun that can take the definite article "the"</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<h3>Using "Other"</h3>
		<p><em>Other</em> can be used alone or after the determiners <em>some</em>, <em>any</em>, and <em>no</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you have <strong>other shoes</strong>?</li>
				<li>There are <strong>other jobs</strong> you could try.</li>
				<li>Is there <strong>any other bread</strong>?</li>
				<li>I have <strong>some other sugar</strong> we could use.</li>
				<li>We have <strong>no other ideas</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>If used with a plural countable noun and one of these determiners, the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context. In that case, <em>other</em> becomes plural. This can also happen with <em>other</em> used by itself, but it is less common.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you have <strong>any others</strong>?</li>
				<li>I know <strong>some others</strong> who might like to come.</li>
				<li>There are <strong>no others</strong> in this box.</li>
				<li>I know <strong>others</strong> like vanilla, but I prefer chocolate.</li>
				<li>She doesn't have to wear that dress. She has <strong>others</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Using "Another"</h3>
		<p>Another is used with singular countable nouns. For uncountable nouns, <em>another</em> is often used with measure words that are singular.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Have <strong>another cookie</strong>.</li>
				<li>Would you like <strong>another cup of tea</strong>?</li>
				<li>He has <strong>another brother</strong>.</li>
				<li>I don't have <strong>another car</strong>.</li>
				<li>I'll come by <strong>another time</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Using "The Other"</h3>
		<p>If <em>the other</em> is modifying a plural countable noun, the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context. In that case, <em>other</em> will become plural.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Where is <strong>the other box</strong> of cereal?</li>
				<li>I work on the weekend and go to school on <strong>the other days</strong> of the week.</li>
				<li>May I use <strong>the other honey</strong> for my recipe?</li>
				<li>I enjoyed the first book but I didn't read <strong>the other books</strong> in the series.</li>
				<li>Have you seen <strong>the others</strong>?</li>
				<li>Jim ate two cookies. I ate <strong>the others</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
