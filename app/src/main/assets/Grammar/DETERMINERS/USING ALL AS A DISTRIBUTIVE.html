	<h1 class="page-title">Using &quot;all&quot; as a distributive</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The distributive determiner <em>all</em> is used to talk about a whole group, with a special emphasis on the fact that nothing has been left out. <em>All</em> can be used as a distributive in several different patterns.</p>
		<p><em>All</em> can be used with uncountable nouns and plural countable nouns by itself. In this usage, it refers to the group as a concept rather than as individuals.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>All cheese</strong> contains protein.</li>
				<li>I like <strong>all dogs</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>All children</strong> need affection.</li>
				<li>This soap is for <strong>all purposes</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>All</em> can be used with uncountable nouns and plural countable nouns preceeded by <em>the</em> or a possessive adjective. In this case, the meaning is shifted towards referring to a concrete, physical group rather than the group as a concept. In these uses, the word <em>of</em> can be added just after <em>all</em> with no change in meaning.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>All the people</strong> in the room were silent.</li>
				<li><strong>All of the birds</strong> flew away.</li>
				<li>Have you eaten <strong>all the bread</strong>?</li>
				<li>I will need <strong>all of the sugar</strong>.</li>
				<li>I've invited <strong>all my friends</strong> to the party.</li>
				<li>I've used up <strong>all of our eggs</strong>.</li>
				<li>You wasted <strong>all your time</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>All</em> can be used with plural pronouns preceeded by <em>of</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>All of us</strong> are going.</li>
				<li>He scolded <strong>all of you</strong>.</li>
				<li>Did you find <strong>all of them</strong>?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>All</em> can be used in questions and exclamations with uncountable nouns preceeded by <em>this</em> or <em>that</em>. In these uses, the word <em>of</em> can be added just after <em>all</em> with no change in meaning.</p>

			<h5>Examples</h5>

				<li>Who has left <strong>all this paper</strong> on my desk?</li>
				<li>Look at <strong>all this snow</strong>!</li>
				<li>Why is <strong>all of that sugar</strong> on the floor?</li>
				<li>Where did <strong>all of this confetti</strong> come from?</li>
