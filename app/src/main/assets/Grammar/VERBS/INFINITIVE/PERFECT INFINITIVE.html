	<h1 class="page-title">Perfect Infinitive</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The perfect infinitive is most commonly found in <b>type 3 conditional sentences</b> as part of the conditional perfect, although it can be used in other places as well. The perfect infinitive is formed:<br>
		<strong>to have + past participle</strong></p>
		<p>As with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form of the perfect infinitive is required, so the word <em>to</em> is omitted. This happens after most modal auxiliaries, and in other places where zero infinitives are used.</p>
