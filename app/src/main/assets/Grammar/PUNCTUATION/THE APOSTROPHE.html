	<h1 class="page-title">The Apostrophe</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The apostrophe probably causes more grief than all of the other punctuation marks put together! The problem nearly always seems to stem from not understanding that the apostrophe has two very different (and very important) uses in English: possession and contractions.</p>
		<h3>The apostrophe in contractions</h3>
		<p>The most common use of apostrophes in English is for contractions, where a noun or pronoun and a verb combine. Remember that the apostrophe is often replacing a letter that has been dropped. It is placed where the missing letter would be in that case.</p>

		<p>People, even native English speakers, often mistake <em>its</em> and <em>it's</em>, <em>you're</em> and <em>your</em>, <em>who's</em> and <em>whose</em>, and <em>they're</em>, <em>their</em> and <em>there</em>. See below for the difference.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>It's</strong> a nice day outside. (contraction)</li>
				<li>The cat is dirty. <strong>Its</strong> fur is matted. (possession)</li>
				<li><strong>You're</strong> not supposed to be here. (contraction)</li>
				<li>This is <strong>your</strong> book. (possession)</li>
				<li><strong>Who's</strong> at the door? (contraction)</li>
				<li><strong>Whose</strong> shoes are these? (possession)</li>
				<li><strong>They're</strong> not here yet. (contraction)</li>
				<li><strong>Their</strong> car is red. (possession)</li>
				<li>His car is over <strong>there</strong>. (location)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>The possessive apostrophe</h3>
		<p>In most cases you simply need to add 's to a noun to show possession</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>a ship's captain</li>
				<li>a doctor's patient</li>
				<li>a car's engine</li>
				<li>Ibrahim's coat</li>
				<li>Mirianna's book</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Plural nouns that do not end in s also follow this rule:</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>the children's room</li>
				<li>the men's work</li>
				<li>the women's club</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Ordinary (or common) nouns that end in s, both singular and plural, show possession simply by adding an apostrophe after the s.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>the bus' wheel</li>
				<li>the babies' crying</li>
				<li>the ladies' tennis club</li>
				<li>the teachers' journal</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Proper nouns (names of people, cities, countries) that end in s can form the possessive either by adding the apostrophe + s or simply adding the apostrophe. Today both forms are considered correct (Jones's or Jones'), and many large organisations now drop the apostrophe completely (e.g. Barclays Bank, Missing Persons Bureau) when publishing their name.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The Hughes' home (or the Hughes's home)</li>
				<li>Mr Jones's shop (or Mr Jones' shop)</li>
				<li>Charles' book (or Charles's book)</li>
			</ul>
