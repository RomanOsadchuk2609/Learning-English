<p>The present participle of most verbs has the form <em>base+ing </em>and is used in the following ways: </p>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">as part of the continuous form of a verb </font><br>
<font size="3" color="Purple"><em>Example:</em></font></strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>I am <strong>working </strong></em></li>
  <li><em>he was <strong>singing </strong></em></li>
  <li><em>they have been <strong>walking </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> <font size="3" color="Purple">after verbs of movement/position in the pattern: <em>verb + present participle </em></font><br>
</strong><font size="3" color="Purple"><strong><em>Example</em></strong></font> </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>She went <strong>shopping </strong></em></li>
  <li><em>He lay <strong>looking </strong>up at the clouds </em></li>
  <li><em>She came <strong>running </strong>towards me </em></li>
</ul>
<p>This construction is particularly useful with the verb <em>'to go' </em>, as in these common expressions : </p>
<table width="26%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="60%" valign="TOP"><p>to go shopping <br>
        to go ski-ing <br>
        to go fishing <br>
        to go surfing </p></td>
    <td width="40%" valign="TOP"><p>to go walking <br>
        to go swimming <br>
        to go running <br>
        to go dancing </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">after verbs of perception in the pattern:</font> <br>
      <em>verb + object + present participle<br>
</em><font size="3" color="Purple"><em>Example </em></font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>I heard someone <strong>singing </strong>. </em></li>
  <li><em>He saw his friend <strong>walking </strong>along the road. </em></li>
  <li><em>I can smell something <strong>burning </strong>! </em></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" color="Purple"><strong>NOTE </strong>:</font> There is a difference in meaning when such a sentence contains a <em>zero-infinitive </em>rather than a participle. The infinitive refers to a <strong>complete </strong>action, but the participle refers to an <strong>incomplete </strong>action, or part of an action. </p>
<p>Compare: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>I heard Joanna </em><em><strong>singing </strong></em>(= she had started before I heard her, and probably went on afterwards) </li>
  <li><em>I heard Joanna <strong>sing </strong></em>(= I heard her complete performance <em>) </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">as an adjective </font><br>
</strong><font size="3" color="Purple"><strong><em>Examples</em></strong> </font></p>
<p><em><strong>amazing, worrying, exciting, boring. </strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>It was an <strong>amazing </strong>film. </em></li>
  <li><em>It's a bit <strong>worrying </strong>when the police stop you </em></li>
  <li><em>Dark <strong>billowing </strong>clouds often precede a storm. </em></li>
  <li><em><strong>Racing </strong>cars can go as fast as 400kph. </em></li>
  <li><em>He was trapped inside the <strong>burning </strong>house. </em></li>
  <li><em>Many of his paintings depict the <strong>setting </strong>sun. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">with the verbs <em>spend </em>and <em>waste </em>, in the pattern:</font> <br>
      <em>verb + time/money expression + present participle <br>
</em></strong><font size="3" color="Purple"><strong><em>Example</em></strong></font> </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>My boss spends two hours a day <strong>travelling </strong>to work. </em></li>
  <li><em>Don't waste time <strong>playing </strong>computer games! </em></li>
  <li><em>They've spent the whole day <strong>shopping </strong>. </em></li>
</ul>
	<p><strong> <font size="3" color="Purple">with the verbs <em>catch </em>and <em>find </em>, in the pattern: </font><br>
      <em>verb + object + present participle: </em></strong></p>
<p>With <em>catch, </em>the participle always refers to an action which causes annoyance or anger: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>If I catch you </em><em><strong>stealing </strong>my apples again, there'll be trouble! </em></li>
  <li><em>Don't let him catch you <strong>reading </strong>his letters. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not the case with <em>find </em>, which is unemotional: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>We found some money </em><em><strong>lying </strong>on the ground. </em></li>
  <li><em>They found their mother <strong>sitting </strong>in the garden. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> <font size="3" color="Purple">to replace a sentence or part of a sentence:</font> </strong></p>
<p>When two actions occur at the same time, and are done by the same person or thing, we can use a present participle to describe one of them: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>They went out into the snow. They laughed as they went. They went </em><em><strong>laughing </strong>out into the snow. <br>
        <br>
  </em></li>
  <li><em>He whistled to himself. He walked down the road. <strong>Whistling </strong>to himself, he walked down the road. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>When one action follows very quickly after another done by the same person or thing, we can express the first action with a present participle: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>He put on his coat and left the house. </em><em><strong>Putting </strong>on his coat, he left the house. <br>
        <br>
  </em></li>
  <li><em>She dropped the gun and put her hands in the air. <strong>Dropping </strong>the gun, she put her hands in the air. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>The present participle can be used instead of a phrase starting <strong><em>as, since, because </em>, </strong>and it explains the cause or reason for an action: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Feeling </strong>hungry, he went into the kitchen and opened the fridge. <br>
    (= because he felt hungry...) </em></li>
  <li><em><strong>Being </strong>poor, he didn't spend much on clothes. </em></li>
  <li><em><strong>Knowing </strong>that his mother was coming, he cleaned the flat. </em></li>
</ul>
