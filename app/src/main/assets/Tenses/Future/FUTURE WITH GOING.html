		<h3>Function</h3>
		<p>The use of <em>going</em> to refer to future events suggests a very strong association with the present. The time is not important, it is later than now, but the attitude is that the event depends on something in the present situation that we know about. <em>Going</em> is mainly used to refer to our plans and intentions or to make predictions based on present evidence. In everyday speech, <em>going to</em> is often shortened to <em>gonna</em>, especially in American English, but it is never written that way.</p>
		<h4>Using "going" for plans and intentions</h4>

				<li><strong>We are going to have</strong> dinner together tomorrow.</li>
				<li><strong>Aren't you going to stay</strong> at the library until your report is finished?</li>
