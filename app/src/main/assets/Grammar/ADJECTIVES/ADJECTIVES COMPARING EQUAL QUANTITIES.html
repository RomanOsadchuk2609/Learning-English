	<div class="content">
					<p>To compare two things that are equal, we use the pattern:</p>
					<p><strong>as + <em>adjective indicating quantity</em> + <em>(noun)</em> + as</strong></p>
					<p>The quantity adjective you use depends if the noun in the comparison is countable or uncountable.</p>
					<h4>Countable nouns</h4>
					<p>Use <em>as many</em> and <em>as few</em> with countable nouns. Note that the noun may be ommitted when it is understood from the context, as in the last example below.</p>
					<div class="alert alert-info">
						<h5>Examples</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>They have <strong>as many children as</strong> we do.</li>
							<li>We have <strong>as many customers as</strong> they do.</li>
							<li>Tom has <strong>as few books as</strong> Jane.</li>
							<li>There are <strong>as few houses in his village as</strong> in mine.</li>
							<li>You know <strong>as many people as</strong> I do.</li>
							<li>I have visited the States <strong>as many times as</strong> he has.</li>
							<li>I have three brothers. That's <strong>as many as</strong> you have. ("brothers" is understood)</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<h4>Uncountable nouns</h4>
					<p>Use <em>as much</em> or <em>as little</em> with uncountable nouns. Note that the noun may be ommitted when it is understood from the context, as in the last example below.</p>
					<div class="alert alert-info">
						<h5>Examples</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>John eats <strong>as much food as</strong> Peter.</li>
							<li>Jim has <strong>as little patience as</strong> Sam.</li>
							<li>You've heard <strong>as much news as</strong> I have.</li>
							<li>He's had <strong>as much success as</strong> his brother has.</li>
							<li>They've got <strong>as little water as</strong> we have.</li>
							<li>I'm not hungry. I've had <strong>as much as</strong> I want. ("food" is understood)</li>
