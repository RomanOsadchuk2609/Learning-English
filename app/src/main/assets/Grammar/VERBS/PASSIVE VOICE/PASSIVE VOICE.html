	<div class="content">
		<h3>Functions of the passive voice</h3>
		<p>The passive voice is used to show interest in the person or object that experiences an action rather than the person or object that performs the action. In other words, the most important thing or person becomes the subject of the sentence.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The passive voice <strong>is used</strong> frequently. (= we are interested in the passive voice, not in who uses it.)</li>
				<li>The house <strong>was built</strong> in 1654. (= we are interested in the house, not in who built it.)</li>
				<li>The road <strong>is being repaired</strong>. (= we are interested in the road, not in the people who are doing the repairs.)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Sometimes we use the passive voice because we don't know or do not want to express who performed the action.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I noticed that a window <strong>had been left</strong> open.</li>
				<li>Every year thousands of people <strong>are killed</strong> on our roads.</li>
				<li>All the cookies <strong>have been eaten</strong>.</li>
				<li>My car <strong>has been stolen</strong>!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>The passive voice is often used in formal texts. Switching to the active voice will make your writing clearer and easier to read.</p>

				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>If we want to say who or what performs the action while using the passive voice, we use the preposition <em>by</em>. When we know who performed the action and are interested in him, it is always better to switch to the active voice instead.</p>

		<h3>Forming the passive voice</h3>
		<p>The passive voice in English is composed of two elements:<br>
		<strong>the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' + past participle</strong></p>
