		<h3>Functions of the Past continuous</h3>
		<p>The past continuous describes actions or events in a time <strong>before now</strong>, which began in the past and is <strong>still going on</strong> at the time of speaking. In other words, it expresses an <strong>unfinished or incomplete action</strong> in the past.</p>
		<p><strong>It is used:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Often, to describe the background in a story written in the past tense, e.g. "The sun <strong>was shining</strong> and the birds <strong>were singing</strong> as the elephant came out of the jungle. The other animals <strong>were relaxing</strong> in the shade of the trees, but the elephant moved very quickly. She <strong>was looking</strong> for her baby, and she didn't notice the hunter who <strong>was watching</strong> her through his binoculars. When the shot rang out, she <strong>was running</strong> towards the river..."</li>
			<li>to describe an unfinished action that was interrupted by another event or action, e.g. "I <strong>was having</strong> a beautiful dream when the alarm clock rang."</li>
			<li>to express a change of mind: e.g. "I <strong>was going</strong> to spend the day at the beach but I've decided to get my homework done instead."</li>
			<li>with <em>'wonder'</em>, to make a very polite request: e.g. "I <strong>was wondering</strong> if you could baby-sit for me tonight."</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Forming the Past continuous</h3>
		<p>The past continuous of any verb is composed of two parts : the past tense of the verb <em>"to be" (was/were)</em>, and the base of the main verb <em>+ing</em>.</p>
