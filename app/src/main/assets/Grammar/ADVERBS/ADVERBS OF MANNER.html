	<h1 class="page-title">Adverbs of manner</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>Adverbs of manner tell us <strong>how</strong> something happens. They are usually placed either after the main verb or after the object.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He swims <strong>well</strong>.</li>
				<li>He ran <strong>quickly</strong>.</li>
				<li>She spoke <strong>softly</strong>.</li>
				<li>James coughed <strong>loudly</strong> to attract her attention.</li>
				<li>He plays the flute <strong>beautifully</strong>. (after the direct object)</li>
				<li>He ate the chocolate cake <strong>greedily</strong>. (after the direct object)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>An adverb of manner cannot be put between a verb and its direct object. The adverb must be placed either before the verb or at the end of the clause.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He ate <strong>greedily</strong> the chocolate cake. <strong>[incorrect]</strong></li>
				<li>He ate the chocolate cake <strong>greedily</strong>. <strong>[correct]</strong></li>
				<li>He <strong>greedily</strong> ate the chocolate cake. <strong>[correct]</strong></li>
				<li>He gave us <strong>generously</strong> the money. <strong>[incorrect]</strong></li>
				<li>He gave us the money <strong>generously</strong>. <strong>[correct]</strong></li>
				<li>He <strong>generously</strong> gave us the money. <strong>[correct]</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>If there is a preposition before the verb's object, you can place the adverb of manner either before the preposition or after the object.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The child ran <strong>happily</strong> towards his mother.</li>
				<li>The child ran towards his mother <strong>happily</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Adverbs of manner should always come immediately after verbs which have no object (intransitive verbs).</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The town grew <strong>quickly</strong> after 1997.</li>
				<li>He waited <strong>patiently</strong> for his mother to arrive.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>These common adverbs of manner are almost always placed directly after the verb: <em>well, badly, hard, &amp; fast</em></p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He swam <strong>well</strong> despite being tired.</li>
				<li>The rain fell <strong>hard</strong> during the storm.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>The position of the adverb is important when there is more than one verb in a sentence. If the adverb is placed before or after the main verb, it modifies only that verb. If the adverb is placed after a clause, then it modifies the whole action described by the clause. Notice the difference in meaning between the following sentences.</p>

		<h4>Literary usage</h4>
		<p>Sometimes an adverb of manner is placed before a verb + object to add emphasis.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He <strong>gently</strong> woke the sleeping woman.</li>
				<li>She <strong>angrily</strong> slammed the door.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Some writers put an adverb of manner at the beginning of the sentence to catch our attention and make us curious.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Slowly</strong> she picked up the knife.</li>
				<li><strong>Roughly</strong> he grabbed her arm.</li>
			</ul>
