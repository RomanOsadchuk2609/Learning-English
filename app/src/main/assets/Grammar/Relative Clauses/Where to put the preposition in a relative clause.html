<p>There are often prepositions in relative clauses, and the relative pronoun is the <em>object </em>of the preposition. This means that the preposition can sometimes be omitted. </p>
<p>The preposition is normally placed at the end of the relative clause: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Is that the man (who) you arrived <em><strong>with </strong>? </em></li>
  <li>Do you know the girl (that) John is talking <em><strong>to </strong>?
  </em></li>
</ul>
<p>In formal or written English, the preposition is often placed before the relative pronoun, and in this case the pronoun cannot be omitted: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The person with whom he is negotiating is the Chairman of a large company. </em></li>
  <li><em>It is a society to which many important people belong. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>However, this is unusual in spoken English. </p>
<h3>Examples </h3>
<ul>
  <li>The jungle <em><strong>the tribe lived in </strong></em>was full of strange and unusual animals. </li>
  <li>He liked the people <em><strong>that he lived with </strong></em>. </li>
  <li>The tree <em><strong>under which they had their picnic </strong></em>was the largest and oldest in the park. </li>
  <li>To the east of the city was a lake <em><strong>that many people went to on the weekend </strong></em>. </li>
  <li>It was the river <em><strong>in which the children preferred to swim </strong></em>. </li>
</ul>
