		<h3>Form</h3>
		<p>When we write about future obligations, we can use a formal pattern composed of two elements<br>
		<strong>the verb to be in the present tense conjugated to match the subject + the infinitive of the main verb</strong></p>
		<h4>To travel, as a future obligation</h4>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Affirmative</th>
					<th>Negative</th>
					<th>Interrogative</th>
					<th>Negative Interrogative</th>
				</tr>

			<tbody>

					<td>I am to travel.</td>
					<td>I am not to travel.</td>
					<td>Am I to travel?</td>
					<td>Am I not to travel?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>You are to travel.</td>
					<td>You are not to travel.</td>
					<td>Are you to travel?</td>
					<td>Aren't you to travel?</td>

					<td>He is to travel.</td>
					<td>He is not to travel.</td>

		<h3>Function</h3>
		<p>In written English, we can use this pattern to refer to an obligation or requirement that we do something at a time later than now. It is similar in meaning to <em>must</em>, but there is a suggestion that something has been arranged or organised for us. It is not normally used in spoken English.</p>
