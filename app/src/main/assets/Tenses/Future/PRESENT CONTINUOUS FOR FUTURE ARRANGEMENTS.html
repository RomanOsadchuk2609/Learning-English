		<h3>Using the present continuous to talk about the future</h3>
		<p>The present continuous is used to talk about <strong>arrangements</strong> for events at a time later than now. There is a suggestion that more than one person is aware of the event, and that some preparation has already happened. e.g.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>I'm meeting</strong> Jim at the airport = Jim and I have discussed this.</li>
			<li><strong>I am leaving</strong> tomorrow. = I've already bought my train ticket.</li>
			<li><strong>We're having</strong> a staff meeting next Monday = all members of staff have been told about it.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Is she seeing</strong> him tomorrow?</li>
				<li><strong>He isn't working</strong> next week.</li>
				<li><strong>They aren't leaving</strong> until the end of next year.</li>
				<li><strong>We are staying</strong> with friends when we get to Boston.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong>In the first example, "seeing" is used in a continuous form because it means "meeting".</p>
		</div>
		<div class="alert alert-danger">
			BE CAREFUL! The <strong>simple present</strong> is used when a future event is part of a programme or time-table.
		</div>
		<p>Notice the difference between:</p>
		<p>a. <strong>We're having</strong> a staff meeting next Monday = just that once<br>
		b. <strong>We have</strong> a staff meeting every Monday</p>
