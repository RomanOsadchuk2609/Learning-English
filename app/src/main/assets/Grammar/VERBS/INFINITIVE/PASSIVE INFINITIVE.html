	<div class="content">
		<p>The passive infinitive is used in some constructions using the passive voice. It is particularly common after modal verbs (<em>may, should, could, etc.</em>) to indicate what is possible or what is correct. The passive infinitive is formed:<br>
		<strong>to be + past participle</strong></p>
		<p>As with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form of the passive infinitive is required, so the word <em>to</em> is omitted. This happens after most modal auxiliaries, and in other places where zero infinitives are used.</p>
