<h3> Gerund or Infinitive ? </h3>
<p>The two groups of verbs below can be followed either by the gerund or by the infinitive. Usually this has no effect on the meaning, but with some verbs there is a clear difference in meaning. Verbs marked * can also be followed by a <em>that-clause.<br>
  <br>
</em><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">Example:</font></strong>  <br>
I prefer <strong>to live </strong>in an apartment. <br>
I prefer <strong>living </strong>in an apartment.</p>
<strong><font size="3" color="Purple">Verbs where there is little or no difference in meaning:</font></strong>

<p><strong>Notes: <br>
</strong>1. <em><strong>Allow </strong></em>is used in these two patterns:<br>
a. <em>Allow + object + to-infinitive: </em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Her parents allowed her <strong>to go </strong>to the party. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>b. <em>Allow + gerund: </em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Her parents don't allow <strong>smoking </strong>in the house. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <em><strong>Deserve </strong></em>+ gerund is not very common, but is mainly used with passive constructions or where there is a passive meaning: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Your proposals deserve <strong>being </strong>considered in detail. </em></li>
  <li><em>These ideas deserve discussing. </em>(= to be discussed). </li>
</ul>
3. The verbs <strong><em>hate, love, like, prefer </em></strong>are usually followed by a gerund when the meaning is <strong><em>general, </em></strong>and by a <em>to-infinitive </em>when they refer to a particular time or situation. You must always use the <em>to-infinitive </em>with the expressions <em>'would love to', 'would hate to', etc. </em>
<p>Compare: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>I hate <strong>to tell </strong>you, but Uncle Jim is coming this weekend. </em></li>
  <li><em>I hate <strong>looking </strong>after elderly relatives! </em></li>
  <li><em>I love <strong>dancing </strong>. </em></li>
  <li><em>I would love <strong>to dance </strong>with you. </em></li>
</ul>

Verbs marked with an asterisk <strong>* </strong>can also be followed by a <em><strong>that-clause </strong>. </em>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><strong>Come + gerund </strong>is like other verbs of movement followed by the gerund, and means that the subject is doing something as they move: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>She came <strong>running </strong>across the field. </em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Come + to-infinitive <em></em></strong>means that something happens or develops, perhaps outside the subject's control: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>At first I thought he was crazy, but I've come <strong>to appreciate </strong>his sense of humour. </em></li>
          <li><em>How did you come <strong>to be </strong>outside the wrong house? </em></li>
          <li><em>This word has come <strong>to mean </strong>something quite different. </em></li>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>When these verbs are followed by a <strong>gerund </strong>, the gerund refers to an action that happened earlier: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>I remember <strong>locking </strong>the door ( </em>= I remember now, I locked the door earlier) </li>
          <li><em>He regretted <strong>speaking </strong>so rudely. </em>(= he regretted at some time in the past, he had spoken rudely at some earlier time in the past.) </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>Forget </em></strong>is frequently used with <em>'never' </em>in the simple future form: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>I'll never forget <strong>meeting </strong>my boss for the first time. </em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When these verbs are followed by a <strong>to-infinitive </strong><em>, </em>the infinitive refers to an action happening at the same time, or later: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>I remembered <strong>to lock </strong>the door </em>(= I thought about it, then I did it.) </li>
          <li><em>Don't forget <strong>to buy </strong>some eggs! </em>(= Please think about it and then do it.) </li>
          <li><em>We regret <strong>to announce </strong>the late arrival of the 12.45 from Paddington. </em>(= We feel sorry before we tell you this bad news.) </li>

          <li><em>I can't go on <strong>working </strong>like this - I'm exhausted. </em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Go on + to-infinitive </strong>means to do the next action, which is often the next stage in a process: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>After introducing her proposal, she went on <strong>to explain </strong>the benefits for the company. </em></li>
          <li><em>John Smith worked in local government for five years, then went on <strong>to become </strong>a Member of Parliament. </em></li>

  <tr>
    <td><p><strong>Mean + gerund </strong>expresses what the result of an action will be, or what will be necessary: </p>
        <ul>

          Stop <strong>tickling </strong>me! </em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Stop + to-infinitive </strong>means to interrupt an activity in order to do something else, so the infinitive is used to express a purpose: </p>
        <ul>
