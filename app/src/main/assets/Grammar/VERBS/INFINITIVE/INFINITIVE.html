		<h3>Forming the infinitive</h3>
		<p>The infinitive is the base form of a verb. In English, when we talk about the infinitive we are usually referring to the present infinitive, which is the most common. There are, however, four other forms of the infinititive: <b>the perfect infinitive, the perfect continuous infinitive, the continuous infinitive, &amp; the passive infinitive</b>.</p>
		<p>The present infinitive has two forms:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>the to-infinitive</strong> = to + base</li>
			<li><strong>the zero infinitive</strong> = base</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The present infinitive base is the verb form you will find in a dictionary.</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>To-infinitive</th>
					<th>Zero infinitive</th>
				</tr>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>to sit</td>
					<td>sit</td>

					<td>eat</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>to have</td>
					<td>have</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

					<td>remember</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>The negative infinitive is formed by putting <em>not</em> in front of any form of the infinitive.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I decided <strong>not to go</strong> to London.</li>
				<li>He asked me <strong>not to be</strong> late.</li>
				<li>I'd like you <strong>not to sing</strong> so loudly.</li>
				<li>I'd rather <strong>not eat</strong> meat.</li>
				<li>I might <strong>not come.</strong></li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Functions of the to-infinitive</h3>
		<p>The to-infinitive is used in many sentence constructions, often expressing the purpose of something or someone's opinion about something. The to-infinitive is used following a large collection of different verbs as well. See the page about <b>verbs followed by infinitives</b>.</p>
		<h4>The to-infinitive to indicate the purpose or intention of an action</h4>
		<p>In this case <em>to</em> has the same meaning as <em>in order to</em> or <em>so as to</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>She <strong>came to collect</strong> her pay cheque.</li>
				<li>The three bears <strong>went to find</strong> firewood.</li>
				<li>I am <strong>calling to ask</strong> you about dad.</li>
				<li>You sister has <strong>gone to finish</strong> her homework.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The to-infinitive as the subject of the sentence</h4>
		<p>This is a formal usage and is far more common in written English than spoken</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>To be</strong> or not to be, that is the question.</li>
				<li><strong>To know</strong> her is to love her.</li>
				<li><strong>To visit</strong> the Grand Canyon is my life-long dream.</li>
				<li><strong>To understand</strong> statistics, that is our aim.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The to-infinitive to indicate what something can or will be used for</h4>
		<p>In this pattern, the to-infinitive follows a noun or pronoun.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The children need a garden <strong>to play</strong> in.</li>
				<li>I would like a sandwich <strong>to eat</strong>.</li>
				<li>I don't have anything <strong>to wear</strong>.</li>
				<li>Would you like something <strong>to drink</strong>?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The to-infinitive after adjectives</h4>
		<p>There is a common pattern using the to-infinitive with an adjective. These phrases are formed:<br>
		<strong>subject + to be + adjective + (for/of someone) + to-infinitive + (rest of sentence)</strong></p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Subject</th>
						<th>+ to be</th>
						<th>+ adjective</th>
						<th>(+ for/of someone)</th>
						<th>+ to-infinitive</th>
						<th>(+ rest of sentence)</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>It</td>
						<td>is</td>
						<td>good</td>
						<td></td>
						<td>to talk.</td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>The dog</td>
						<td>is</td>
						<td>naughty</td>
						<td></td>
						<td>to destroy</td>
						<td>our couch.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</div>
		<h4>The to-infinitive to make a comment or judgement</h4>
		<p>To use the to-infinitive when making a comment or judgement about a noun, the pattern is:<br>
		<strong>Subject + to be + noun phrase + to-infinitive</strong></p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Subject</th>
						<th>+ to be</th>
						<th>+ noun phrase</th>
						<th>+ to-infinitive</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>It</td>
						<td>was</td>
						<td>a stupid place</td>
						<td>to park.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>That</td>
						<td>is</td>
						<td>a dangerous way</td>
						<td>to behave.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>What you said</td>
						<td>was</td>
						<td>a rude thing</td>
						<td>to say.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>This</td>
						<td>is</td>
						<td>the right thing</td>
						<td>to do.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Those</td>
						<td>were</td>
						<td>the wrong kind of eggs</td>
						<td>to buy.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Jim</td>
						<td>is</td>
						<td>the best person</td>
						<td>to hire.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</div>
		<h4>The to-infinitive with adverbs</h4>
		<p>The to-infinitive is used frequently with the adverbs <em>too</em> and <em>enough</em> to express the reasoning behind our satisfaction or insatisfaction. The pattern is that <em>too</em> and <em>enough</em> are placed before or after the adjective, adverb, or noun that they modify in the same way they would be without the to-infinitive. We then follow them by the to-infinitive to explain the reason why the quantity is excessive, sufficient, or insufficient. Normally the to-infinitive and everything that follows can be removed, leaving a sentence that still functions grammatically.</p>
