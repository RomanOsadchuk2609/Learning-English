		<h3>Reporting hopes, intentions, and promises</h3>
		<p>When we report an intention, hope or promise, we use an appropriate reporting verb followed by a 'that' clause with 'would' in it, or a to-infinitive clause. Verbs used in this pattern include: <strong>hope, promise, threaten, guarantee, &amp; swear</strong>. Note that the word 'that' is optional when using a that clause, as in the first example below.</p>
