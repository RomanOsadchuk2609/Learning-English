	It looks like you don&prime;t know what happened.<br>
	Perhaps she knows the answer.<br>
	I&prime;d say it&prime;s over 9 A.M now.<br>
	If I had to take a guess, I&prime;d say he&prime;s 40.<br>
	Maybe he wants to quit his job.<br>
	Maybe it&prime;s going to rain.<br>
	Chances are you&prime;re doing it wrong<br>
	He could be right about it.<br>
	I guess you are over 30 years old.<br>
	It&prime;s difficult to say, but I think this is the best English course.<br>
	I&prime;m not really sure, but I think this is the last morning train.<br>
