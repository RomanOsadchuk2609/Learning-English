<p>Many speakers tend to get confused between 'There', 'Their' and 'They're' and knowing how to use these three words correctly is an important step in learning English. </p>
<p>The words 'There' and' Their' are homophones. Homophones are words that are spelt differently but pronounced the same. It is a common mistake to replace one for the other. </p>
<p>'There' always refers to a place, whether concrete or abstract, whereas 'Their' shows belonging or possession. 'They're, on the other hand, is the short form of they are </p>
<p>Let's look at these examples for each of them </p>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>THERE</strong></font>: </p>
<p>How can anyone live there? </p>
<p>Let's go there. </p>
<p>There will be a party tomorrow, </p>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>THEIR</strong></font>: </p>
<p>Let us buy their car. </p>
<p>Let us not go to their house. </p>
<p>Return their books tomorrow. </p>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>THEY'RE</strong></font>: </p>
<p>They're sitting there in their car. </p>
<p>In this sentence, notice how 'there' is used to signify a place whereas 'their' is used to show possession. The word 'they're' is a contraction of the word 'they' and 'are' and should not be confused with 'their' and 'there'. </p>
