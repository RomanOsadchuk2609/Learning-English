<p align="left">We don't use <strong>'<font color='purple'>Shall</font>'</strong> very frequently in modern English, particularly in American English. </p>
<p align="left">It is used to make offers and suggestions and to ask for advice. </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>What time <font color='purple'>shall</font> we meet? </em></li>
  <li><em><font color='purple'>Shall</font> we vote on it now? </em></li>
  <li><em>What dress <font color='purple'>shall</font> I wear? </em></li>
  <li><em><font color='purple'>Shall</font> I open the window? </em></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You only really need to know that about '<font color='purple'>shall</font>' in modern English. Read the rest of this only if you want to know more about how some older speakers still use '<font color='purple'>shall</font>'. </p>
<p align="left">Formerly, in older grammar, '<font color='purple'>shall</font>' was used as an alternative to 'will' with 'I' and 'we'. Today, 'will' is normally used. When we do use '<font color='purple'>shall</font>', it has an idea of a more personal, subjective future. </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>I <font color='purple'>shall</font> go to see the boss and I <font color='purple'>shall</font> ask him to explain this decision. </em></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Notice that the negative of ' <font color='purple'>shall</font> ' can be ' <font color='purple'>shall</font> not ' or ' shan't ' - though the second one is now very rare in American English. </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>I don't like these people and I <font color='purple'>shall</font> not go to their party. </em></li>
  <li><em>I shan't object if you go without me. </em></li>
</ul>
