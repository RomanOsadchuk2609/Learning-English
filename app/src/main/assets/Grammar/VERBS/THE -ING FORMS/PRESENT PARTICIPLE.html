	<div class="content">
		<p>The present participle of most verbs has the form <strong>base+ing</strong>. It is used in many different ways.</p>
		<h4>The present participle as part of the continuous form of a verb</h4>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I <strong>am working</strong>.</li>
				<li>He <strong>was singing</strong>.</li>
				<li>They <strong>have been walking</strong>.</li>
				<li>We <strong>will be staying</strong>.</li>
				<li>She <strong>would have been expecting</strong> me.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The present participle after verbs of movement &amp; position</h4>
		<p>This construction is particularly useful with the verb <em>to go</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>She <strong>went shopping</strong>.</li>
				<li>I <strong>go running</strong> every morning.</li>
				<li>He <strong>lay looking</strong> up at the clouds.</li>
				<li>She <strong>came running</strong> towards me.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The present participle after verbs of perception</h4>
		<p>The pattern for this usage is <strong>verb + object + present participle</strong>. There is a difference in meaning when such a sentence contains a zero infinitive rather than a participle. The infinitive refers to a complete action while the present participle refers to an ongoing action.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I heard someone <strong>singing</strong>.</li>
				<li>He saw his friend <strong>walking</strong> along the road.</li>
				<li>I can smell something <strong>burning</strong>!</li>
				<li>I watched the birds <strong>flying</strong> away.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The present participle as an adjective</h4>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>It was an <strong>amazing</strong> film.</li>
				<li>Dark <strong>billowing</strong> clouds often precede a storm.</li>
				<li>He was trapped inside the <strong>burning</strong> house.</li>
				<li>Many of his paintings show the <strong>setting</strong> sun.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The present participle with the verbs spend and waste</h4>
		<p>The pattern with these verbs is <strong>verb + time/money expression + present participle</strong>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>My boss <strong>spends two hours a day travelling</strong> to work.</li>
				<li>Don't <strong>waste time playing</strong> computer games!</li>
				<li>They've <strong>spent the whole day shopping</strong>.</li>
				<li>I <strong>wasted money buying</strong> this game.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The present participle with the verbs catch and find</h4>
		<p>The pattern with these verbs is <strong>verb + object + present participle</strong>. With <em>catch</em>, the participle always refers to an action which causes annoyance or anger. This is not the case with <em>find</em>, which is unemotional.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>If I <strong>catch you stealing</strong> my apples again, there'll be trouble!</li>
				<li>Don't let him <strong>catch you reading</strong> his letters.</li>
				<li>I <strong>caught him going</strong> through my bag.</li>
				<li>We <strong>found some money lying</strong> on the ground.</li>
				<li>They <strong>found their mother sitting</strong> in the garden.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The present participle for two actions at the same time</h4>
		<p>When two actions occur at the same time, and are done by the same person or thing, we can use a present participle to describe one of them. When one action follows very quickly after another done by the same person or thing, we can express the first action with a present participle.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Whistling</strong> to himself, he walked down the road. = He whistled to himself as he walked down the road.</li>
				<li>They went <strong>laughing</strong> out into the snow. = They laughed as they went out into the snow.</li>
				<li><strong>Dropping</strong> the gun, she put her hands in the air. = She dropped the gun and put her hands in the air.</li>
				<li><strong>Putting</strong> on his coat, he left the house. = He put on his coat and left the house.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The present participle to explain a reason</h4>
		<p>The present participle can be used instead of a phrase starting with <em>as, since</em>, or <em>because</em>. In this usage the participial phrase explains the cause or reason for an action.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Feeling</strong> hungry, he went into the kitchen and opened the fridge.</li>
				<li><strong>Being</strong> poor, he didn't spend much on clothes.</li>
				<li><strong>Knowing</strong> that his mother was coming, he cleaned the flat.</li>
				<li>He whispered, <strong>thinking</strong> his brother was still asleep.</li>
			</ul>
