	<h1 class="page-title">Immediate Future</h1>
	<h3>Form</h3>
	<p>When we talk about the immediate future, we can use a pattern composed of three elements:<br>
	<strong>the verb "to be", conjugated in the present tense, + about + the infinitive of the main verb</strong></p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Subject</th>
				<th>+ to be</th>
				<th>+ about (or just about)</th>
				<th>+ infinitive</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>I</td>
				<td>am</td>
				<td>about</td>
				<td>to be sick</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>They</td>
				<td>are</td>
				<td>about</td>
				<td>to arrive.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>It</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td>just about</td>
				<td>to explode.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<h4>To leave, in the immediate future</h4>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Affirmative</th>
				<th>Negative</th>
				<th>Interrogative</th>
				<th>Negative Interrogative</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>I am about to leave.</td>
				<td>I am not about to leave.</td>
				<td>Am I about to leave?</td>
				<td>Am I not about to leave?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>You are about to leave.</td>
				<td>You are not about to leave.</td>
				<td>Are you about to leave?</td>
				<td>Aren't you about to leave?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>He is about to leave.</td>
				<td>He is not about to leave.</td>
				<td>Is he about to leave?</td>
				<td>Isn't he about to leave?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>We are about to leave.</td>
				<td>We aren't about to leave.</td>
				<td>Are we about to leave?</td>
				<td>Aren't we about to leave?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>They are about to leave.</td>
				<td>They aren't about to leave.</td>
				<td>Are they about to leave?</td>
				<td>Aren't they about to leave?</td>

	<h3>Function</h3>
	<p>This pattern is used to refer to a time immediately after the moment of speaking, and emphasises that the event or action will happen very soon. We often add the word <em>just</em> before the word <em>about</em>, which emphasises the immediacy of the action.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info">
		<h5>Examples</h5>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>She is about to cry</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>You are about to see</strong> something very unusual.</li>
			<li><strong>I am about to go</strong> to a meeting.</li>
			<li><strong>We are just about to go</strong> inside.</li>
			<li><strong>Sally is just about to jump</strong> off that diving board.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>This pattern can also be used with the simple past tense of <em>to be</em> in place of the present tense, to refer to an action that was imminent, but was interrupted. That pattern is often followed by a clause introduced by <em>when</em>.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info">
		<h5>Examples</h5>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>She was about to leave</strong> when Jim arrived.</li>
			<li>When it started to rain, <strong>I was about to go</strong> out for a walk.</li>
			<li><strong>I was just about to call</strong> her when she walked in.</li>
			<li><strong>The car was just about to flip</strong> over when he regained control.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
