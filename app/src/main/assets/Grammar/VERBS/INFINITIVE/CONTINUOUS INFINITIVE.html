	<h1 class="page-title">Continuous infinitive</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The continuous infinitive is used to express a continuing action after a verb or auxiliary which must be followed by the infinitive. The continuous infinitive is formed:<br>
		<strong>to be + present participle</strong></p>
		<p>As with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form of the continuous infinitive is required, so the word <em>to</em> is omitted. This happens after most modal auxiliaries, and in other places where zero infinitives are used.</p>

				<li>You must <strong>be joking</strong>!</li>
				<li>We should <strong>be hurrying</strong>. We're late!</li>
