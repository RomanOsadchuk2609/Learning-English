		<h3>Functions of the simple future tense</h3>
		<p>The simple future refers to a time later than now, and expresses facts or certainty. In this case there is no 'attitude'.</p>
		<p><strong>The simple future is used:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>To predict a future event:<br>
			It <strong>will rain</strong> tomorrow.</li>
			<li>With I or We, to express a spontaneous decision:<br>
			<strong>I'll pay</strong> for the tickets by credit card.</li>
			<li>To express willingness:<br>
			<strong>I'll do</strong> the washing-up.<br>
			<strong>He'll carry</strong> your bag for you.</li>
			<li>In the negative form, to express unwillingness:<br>
			The baby <strong>won't eat</strong> his soup.<br>
			I <strong>won't leave</strong> until I've seen the manager!</li>
			<li>With I in the interrogative form using "shall", to make an offer:<br>
			<strong>Shall I open</strong> the window?</li>
			<li>With we in the interrogative form using "shall", to make a suggestion:<br>
			<strong>Shall we go</strong> to the cinema tonight?</li>
			<li>With I in the interrogative form using "shall", to ask for advice or instructions:<br>
			What <strong>shall I tell</strong> the boss about this money?</li>
			<li>With you, to give orders:<br>
			You <strong>will do</strong> exactly as I say.</li>
			<li>With you in the interrogative form, to give an invitation:<br>
			<strong>Will you come</strong> to the dance with me?<br>
			<strong>Will you marry</strong> me?</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong>In modern English <strong>will</strong> is preferred to <strong>shall</strong>. Shall is mainly used with <strong>I</strong> and <strong>we</strong> to make an offer or suggestion, or to ask for advice (see examples above). With the other persons (you, he, she, they) shall is only used in literary or poetic situations, e.g. <em>"With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, She <strong>shall have</strong> music wherever she goes."</em></p>
		<h3>Forming the simple future</h3>
		<p>The simple future tense is composed of two parts: <em>will / shall</em> + the infinitive without <em>to</em></p>
