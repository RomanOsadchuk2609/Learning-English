		<h3>Definition of the simple past tense</h3>
		<p>The simple past tense, sometimes called the preterite, is used to talk about a <strong>completed action</strong> in a time <strong>before now</strong>. The simple past is the basic form of past tense in English. The time of the action can be in the recent past or the distant past and action duration is not important.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>John Cabot <strong>sailed</strong> to America in 1498.</li>
				<li>My father <strong>died</strong> last year.</li>
				<li>He <strong>lived</strong> in Fiji in 1976.</li>
				<li>We <strong>crossed</strong> the Channel yesterday.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>You always use the simple past when you say <strong>when</strong> something happened, so it is associated with certain past time expressions</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>frequency</strong>: <em>often, sometimes, always</em><br>
			I sometimes <strong>walked</strong> home at lunchtime.<br>
			I often <strong>brought</strong> my lunch to school.</li>
			<li><strong>a definite point in time</strong>: <em>last week, when I was a child, yesterday, six weeks ago</em><br>
			We <strong>saw</strong> a good film <em>last week</em>.<br>
			<em>Yesterday</em>, I <strong>arrived</strong> in Geneva.<br>
			She <strong>finished</strong> her work at<em>seven o'clock</em><br>
			I <strong>went</strong> to the theatre <em>last night</em></li>
			<li><strong>an indefinite point in time</strong>: <em>the other day, ages ago, a long time ago</em><br>
			People <strong>lived</strong> in caves a <em>long time ago</em>.<br>
			She <strong>played</strong> the piano <em>when she was a child</em>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> the word <em>ago</em> is a useful way of expressing the distance into the past. It is placed <strong>after</strong> the period of time: <em>a week ago, three years ago, a minute ago</em>.</p>

			Be Careful: The simple past in English may look like a tense in your own language, but the meaning may be different.

		<h3>Notes on affirmative, negative, &amp; interrogative forms</h3>
		<h4>Affirmative</h4>
		<p>The affirmative of the simple past tense is simple.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I <strong>was</strong> in Japan last year</li>
			<li>She <strong>had</strong> a headache yesterday.</li>
			<li>We <strong>did</strong> our homework last night.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Negative and interrogative</h4>
		<p>For the negative and interrogative simple past form of <em>"to do"</em> as an ordinary verb, use the auxiliary <em>"did",</em> e.g. We <strong>didn't do</strong> our homework last night.<br>
		The negative of <em>"have"</em> in the simple past is usually formed using the auxiliary <em>"did"</em>, but sometimes by simply adding <em>not</em> or the contraction <em>"n't"</em>.</p>
		<p>The interrogative form of <em>"have"</em> in the simple past normally uses the auxiliary <em>"did".</em></p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<ul>
				<li>They <strong>weren't</strong> in Rio last summer.</li>
				<li>We <strong>didn't have</strong> any money.</li>
