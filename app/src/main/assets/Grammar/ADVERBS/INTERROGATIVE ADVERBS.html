	<div class="content">
		<p>The interrogative adverbs <em>why, where, how, &amp; when</em> are placed at the beginning of a question. These questions can be answered with a sentence or a prepositional phrase. After an interrogative adverb in a question, you must invert the subject and verb so that the verb comes first.</p>

			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Why</strong> are you so late? There was a lot of traffic.</li>
				<li><strong>Where</strong> is my passport? In the drawer.</li>

				<li><strong>When</strong> does the train arrive? At 11:15.</li>
			</ul>
