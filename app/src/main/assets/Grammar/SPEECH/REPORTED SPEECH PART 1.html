		<h3>Reporting orders and requests</h3>
		<p>When we want to report an order or request, we can use a verb like 'tell' with a to-clause: <em>He told me to go away.</em> The pattern is <strong>verb + indirect object + to-clause</strong>. The indirect object is the person spoken to. Other verbs used to report orders and requests in this way are: <strong>command, order, warn, ask, advise, invite, beg, teach, &amp; forbid.</strong></p>

		<h4>Requests for objects</h4>
		<p>Requests for objects are reported using the pattern "asked for" + object.</p>

		<h3>Suggestions</h3>
		<p>Suggestions are most often reported using the verbs suggest, insist, recommend, demand, request, and propose followed by a that clause. 'That' and 'should' are optional in these clauses, as shown in the first two examples below. Note that suggest, recommend, and propose may also be followed by a gerund in order to eliminate the indirect object (the receiver of the suggestion) and thus make the suggestion more polite. This usage of the gerund is illustrated in the fourth and fifth examples below.</p>
