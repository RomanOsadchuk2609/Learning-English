	<div class="content">
		<p>You can form sentences that are passive in meaning but not in form by using <b>the verb <em>to get</em></b> or the verb <em>to have</em> in place of the verb <em>to be</em>. These constructions often describe situations where we want someone else to do something for us or where we are going to hire someone else to do something for us. The subject is active, but he is only doing the "getting". It is the unnamed person who is gotten who will perform the action of the main verb in the sentence. That second person is not explicit in the sentence when the sentence has a passive meaning. We are more interested in the result of the activity than in the person that performs the activity.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I must <strong>get my hair cut.</strong></li>
				<li>I must <strong>have my hair cut</strong>.</li>
				<li>When are you going to <strong>get that window mended</strong>?</li>
				<li>We're <strong>having the house painted</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>This type of construction can refer to the completion of an activity, especially if a time expression is used.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>We'll <strong>get the work done</strong> as soon as possible.</li>
				<li>I'll <strong>get those letters typed</strong> before lunchtime.</li>
				<li>She said she'd <strong>have my lunch delivered</strong> by noon.</li>
				<li>You should <strong>have your roof repaired</strong> before next winter.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>If the verb refers to something unwanted, it has the same meaning as a passive sentence.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Jim <strong>had his car stolen</strong> last night.</li>
				<li>Jim's car <strong>was stolen</strong>.</li>
				<li>They <strong>had their roof blown off</strong> in the storm.</li>
				<li>Their roof <strong>was blown off</strong> in the storm.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Using "to need" in passive constructions</h4>
		<p>You can also use the verb <em>to need</em> followed by the gerund in an active construction with a passive meaning. The important thing in our minds in these sentences is the person or thing that will experience the action, not the person performing the action.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The ceiling <strong>needs painting</strong>.</li>
				<li>The ceiling <strong>needs to be painted</strong>.</li>
				<li>My hair <strong>needs cutting</strong>.</li>
				<li>My hair <strong>needs to be cut</strong>.</li>
				<li>That faucet <strong>needs fixing</strong>.</li>
				<li>That faucet <strong>needs to be fixed</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
