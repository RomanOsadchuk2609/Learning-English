	<div class="content">
		<p>Use the question mark at the end of all direct questions.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>What is your name?</li>
				<li>Do you speak Italian?</li>
				<li>You're spanish, aren't you?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Do not use a question mark for reported questions</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He asked me what my name was.</li>
				<li>She asked if I was Spanish.</li>
				<li>Ask them where they are going.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Long questions still need question marks</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Isn't it true that global warming is responsible for more and more problems which are having a disastrous effect on the world's climate and leading to many millions of people in countries that can least afford it having to contend with more and more hardship?</li>
				<li>Why is it that even though you are unkind to me, ignore me when I ask you for help, and consistently forget to thank me when I do favors for you, you still claim to want me to be your friend and appear surprised when I prefer to hang out with other people?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Question marks can sometimes appear within sentences</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>There is cause for concern (isn't there?) that the current world economic balance is so fragile that it may lead to a global economic downturn.</li>
				<li>"Why is she here?" asked Henry.</li>
			</ul>
