		<h3>Comparative adjectives</h3>
		<p>Comparative adjectives are used to compare differences between the two objects they modify (<em>larger, smaller, faster, higher</em>). They are used in sentences where two nouns are compared, in this pattern:</p>
		<p><strong>Noun (subject) + verb + comparative adjective + <em>than</em> + noun (object).</strong></p>
		<p>The second item of comparison can be omitted if it is clear from the context (final example below).</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>My house is <strong>larger</strong> than hers.</li>
				<li>This box is <strong>smaller</strong> than the one I lost.</li>
				<li>Your dog runs <strong>faster</strong> than Jim's dog.</li>
				<li>The rock flew <strong>higher</strong> than the roof.</li>
				<li>Jim and Jack are both my friends, but I like Jack <strong>better</strong>. ("than Jim" is understood)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Superlative adjectives</h3>
		<p>Superlative adjectives are used to describe an object which is at the upper or lower limit of a quality (<em>the tallest, the smallest, the fastest, the highest</em>). They are used in sentences where a subject is compared to a group of objects.</p>
		<p><strong>Noun (subject) + verb + the + superlative adjective + noun (object).</strong></p>
		<p>The group that is being compared with can be omitted if it is clear from the context (final example below).</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>My house is the <strong>largest</strong> one in our neighborhood.</li>
				<li>This is the <strong>smallest</strong> box I've ever seen.</li>
				<li>Your dog ran the <strong>fastest</strong> of any dog in the race.</li>
				<li>We all threw our rocks at the same time. My rock flew the <strong>highest</strong>. ("of all the rocks" is understood)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Forming regular comparatives and superlatives</h3>
		<p>Forming comparatives and superlatives is easy. The form depends on the number of syllables in the original adjective.</p>
		<h4>One syllable adjectives</h4>
		<p>Add <em>-er</em> for the comparative and <em>-est</em> for the superlative. If the adjective has a consonant + single vowel + consonant spelling, the final consonant must be doubled before adding the ending.</p>

		<h4>Two syllables</h4>
		<p>Adjectives with two syllables can form the comparative either by adding <em>-er</em> or by preceeding the adjective with <em>more</em>. These adjectives form the superlative either by adding <em>-est</em> or by preceeding the adjective with <em>most</em>. In many cases, both forms are used, although one usage will be more common than the other. If you are not sure whether a two-syllable adjective can take a comparative or superlative ending, play it safe and use <em>more</em> and <em>most</em> instead. For adjectives ending in <em>y</em>, change the y to an i before adding the ending.</p>
