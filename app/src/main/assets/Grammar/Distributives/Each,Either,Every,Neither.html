<p>These distributive words are normally used with singular nouns, and are placed before the noun. </p>
<p><em><strong>Each, either </strong></em>and <em><strong>neither </strong></em>can be used with plural nouns but must be followed by <em>' <strong>of </strong>' </em>: </p>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">Each </font></strong>is a way of seeing the members of a group as individuals: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Each </strong>child received a present. </em></li>
  <li><em><strong>Each of </strong>the children received a present. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><font size="3" color="Purple">Every </font></strong>is a way of seeing a group as a series of members: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Every </strong>child in the world deserves affection. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>It can also express different points in a series, especially with time expressions: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Every </strong>third morning John goes jogging. </em></li>
  <li><em>This magazine is published <strong>every </strong>other week. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" color="Purple"><strong>Either </strong>and <strong>Neither </strong></font>are concerned with distribution between two things - <em><strong>either </strong></em>is positive, <em><strong>neither </strong></em>is negative: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Which chair do you want? </em><em><strong>Either </strong>chair will do. </em></li>
  <li><em>I can stay at <strong>either </strong>hotel, they are both good </em></li>
  <li><em>There are two chairs here. You can take <strong>either of </strong>them </em>. </li>
  <li><em><strong>Neither </strong>chair is any good, they're both too small. </em></li>
  <li><em>Which chair do you want? <strong>Neither of </strong>them - they're both too small. </em></li>
</ul>
