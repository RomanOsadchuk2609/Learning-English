	<header>
		<p>Nouns answer the questions <strong>"What is it?"</strong> and <strong>"Who is it?"</strong> They give names to things, people, and places.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>dog</li>
				<li>bicycle</li>
				<li>Mary</li>
				<li>girl</li>
				<li>beauty</li>
				<li>France</li>
				<li>world</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>In general there is no distinction between masculine, feminine in English nouns. However, gender is sometimes shown by different forms or different words when referring to people or animals.</p>

		<p>Many nouns that refer to people's roles and jobs can be used for either a masculine or a feminine subject, like for example <em>cousin, teenager, teacher, doctor, student, friend, colleague</em></p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Mary is my friend. She is a doctor.</li>
				<li>Peter is my cousin. He is a doctor.</li>
				<li>Arthur is my friend. He is a student.</li>
				<li>Jane is my cousin. She is a student.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>It is possible to make the distinction for these neutral words by adding the words <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Sam is a female doctor.</li>
				<li>No, he is not my boyfriend, he is just a male friend.</li>
				<li>I have three female cousins and two male cousins.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Infrequently, nouns describing things without a gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to show familiarity. It is also correct to use the gender-neutral pronoun (it).</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I love my car. <strong>She</strong> (the car) is my greatest passion.</li>
				<li>France is popular with <strong>her</strong> (France's) neighbours at the moment.</li>
				<li>I travelled from England to New York on the Queen Elizabeth; <strong>she</strong> (the Queen Elizabeth) is a great ship.</li>
			</ul>
