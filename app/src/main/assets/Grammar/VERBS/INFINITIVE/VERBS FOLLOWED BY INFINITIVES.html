	<div class="content">
		<p>Many different verbs are followed, or can be followed, by a second verb in the infinitive. All of the verbs listed on on this page are followed by a to-infinitive when the infinitive is used. Verbs marked with an asterix can also be followed by a that-clause, as shown in the examples. Verbs marked with two asterix can only be followed by a that-clause when the subject of the primary verb is "it".</p>

		<h4>Verbs without a noun before a that-clause</h4>
		<p>When certain verbs are followed by a that-clause, there is no noun before the that clause even though there is a noun before the infinitive. This is the case for the verbs <em>command, direct, entreat, implore, order, require, &amp; trust</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I <strong>trust you to tell</strong> the truth.</li>
				<li>I <strong>trust that</strong> you are telling the truth.</li>
				<li>The general <strong>commanded his men to surrender</strong>.</li>
				<li>The general <strong>commanded that</strong> his men surrender.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Verbs with a noun before a that-clause</h4>
		<p>Other verbs, when followed by a that-clause require a noun before the that-clause, just as before the infinitive. This is the case for the verbs <em>persuade &amp; remind</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>You can't <strong>persuade people to buy</strong> small cars.</li>
				<li>You can't <strong>persuade people that</strong> small cars are better.</li>
				<li>He <strong>reminded me to take</strong> my notebook to school.</li>
				<li>He <strong>reminded me that</strong> I would need my notebook.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Verbs with an optional noun before a that-clause</h4>
		<p>A final group of verbs when followed by a that-clause take an optional noun before the that clause. This is the case for the verbs <em>instruct, teach, &amp; warn</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>She <strong>taught her students to appreciate</strong> poetry.</li>
				<li>She <strong>taught her students that</strong> poetry was valuable.</li>
				<li>She <strong>taught that</strong> poetry was valuable.</li>

			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Using to dare</h4>
		<p>In negative and interrogative sentences the infinitive with or without 'to' is possible as long as the subject of both verbs is the same, though it is more common to omit the 'to'. If the subject of the two verbs is different, you must include to.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I <strong>never dared tell</strong> him what happened.</li>
				<li>Do you <strong>dare tell</strong> him?</li>
				<li>Would you <strong>dare (to) jump</strong> out of a plane?</li>
				<li>I <strong>dare you to tell</strong> him the truth.</li>
				<li>She <strong>dared me to jump</strong> off the wall.</li>
