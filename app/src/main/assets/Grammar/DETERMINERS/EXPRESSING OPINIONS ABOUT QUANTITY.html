	<div class="content">
		<p>The quantifiers <em>few</em> and <em>a few</em>, and <em>little</em> and <em>a little</em> seem nearly identical but they are actually quite distinct. These expressions show the speaker's attitude towards the quantity he is referring to as either positive or negative.</p>
		<h6>Positive attitude</h6>
		<p><strong>A few</strong> (for countable nouns) and <strong>a little</strong> (for uncountable nouns) describe the quantity in a positive way, implying that although the speaker may not have much, he has enough.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I've got <strong>a few</strong> friends. = I have enough friends.</li>
				<li>I have <strong>a few flowers</strong> in my garden. = I have enough flowers.</li>
				<li>I've got <strong>a little money</strong>. = I have enough money.</li>
				<li>I have <strong>a little free time</strong> on Thursdays. = I have enough free time.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h6>Negative attitude</h6>
		<p><strong>Few</strong> (for countable nouns) and <strong>little</strong> (for uncountable nouns) describe the quantity in a negative way. They may actually indicate a total lack of the noun, but are more polite than saying so directly.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Few</strong> people visited him in hospital. = he had almost no visitors, or perhaps no visitors at all.</li>
				<li>I've seen <strong>few</strong> birds around here. = there are almost no birds, or perhaps not a single bird</li>
				<li>He had <strong>little</strong> money for treats. = almost no money, or perhaps no money at all</li>
				<li>I have <strong>little</strong> time for TV = almost no time, or perhaps no time at all</li>
