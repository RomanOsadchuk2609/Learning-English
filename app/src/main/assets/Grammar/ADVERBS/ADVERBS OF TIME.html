	<div class="content">
		<p>Adverbs of time tell us <b>when</b> an action happened, but also <b>for how long</b>, and <b>how often</b>. Adverbs of time are invariable. They are extremely common in English. Adverbs of time have standard positions in a sentence depending on what the adverb of time is telling us.</p>
		<h3>Adverbs that tell us when</h3>
		<p>Adverbs that tell us when are usually placed at the end of the sentence.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Goldilocks went to the Bears' house <strong>yesterday</strong>.</li>
				<li>I'm going to tidy my room <strong>tomorrow</strong>.</li>
				<li>I saw Sally <strong>today</strong>.</li>
				<li>I will call you <strong>later</strong>.</li>
				<li>I have to leave <strong>now</strong>.</li>
				<li>I saw that movie <strong>last year</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Putting an adverb that tells us when at the end of a sentence is a neutral position, but these adverbs can be put in other positions to give a different emphasis. All adverbs that tell us when can be placed at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize the time element. Some can also be put before the main verb in formal writing, while others cannot occupy that position.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Later</strong> Goldilocks ate some porridge. (the time is important)</li>
				<li>Goldilocks <strong>later</strong> ate some porridge. (this is more formal, like a policeman's report)</li>
				<li>Goldilocks ate some porridge <strong>later</strong>. (this is neutral, no particular emphasis)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Adverbs that tell us for how long</h3>
		<p>Adverbs that tell us for how long are also usually placed at the end of the sentence.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>She stayed in the Bears' house <strong>all day</strong>.</li>
				<li>My mother lived in France <strong>for a year</strong>.</li>
				<li>I have been going to this school <strong>since 1996</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>In these adverbial phrases that tell us for how long, <em>for</em> is always followed by an expression of duration, while <em>since</em> is always followed by an expression of a point in time.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I stayed in Switzerland <strong>for three days</strong>.</li>
				<li>I am going on vacation <strong>for a week</strong>.</li>
				<li>I have been riding horses <strong>for several years</strong>.</li>
				<li>The French monarchy lasted <strong>for several centuries</strong>.</li>
				<li>I have not seen you <strong>since Monday</strong>.</li>
				<li>Jim has been working here <strong>since 1997</strong>.</li>
				<li>There has not been a more exciting discovery <strong>since last century</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Adverbs that tell us how often</h3>
		<p>Adverbs that tell us how often express the frequency of an action. They are usually placed before the main verb but after auxiliary verbs (such as <em>be, have, may, &amp; must</em>). The only exception is when the main verb is "to be", in which case the adverb goes after the main verb.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I <strong>often</strong> eat vegetarian food.</li>
				<li>He <strong>never</strong> drinks milk.</li>
				<li>You must <strong>always</strong> fasten your seat belt.</li>
				<li>I am <strong>seldom</strong> late.</li>
				<li>He <strong>rarely</strong> lies.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Many adverbs that express frequency can also be placed at either the beginning or the end of the sentence, although some cannot be. When they are placed in these alternate positions, the meaning of the adverb is much stronger.</p>

		<p>Some other adverbs that tell us how often express the exact number of times an action happens or happened. These adverbs are usually placed at the end of the sentence.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>This magazine is published <strong>monthly</strong>.</li>
				<li>He visits his mother <strong>once a week</strong>.</li>
				<li>I work <strong>five days a week</strong>.</li>
				<li>I saw the movie <strong>seven times</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Using Yet</h3>
		<p><em>Yet</em> is used in questions and in negative sentences to indicate that something that has not happened or may not have happened but is expected to happen. It is placed at the end of the sentence or after <em>not</em>.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Have you finished your work <strong>yet</strong>? (= simple request for information)</li>
				<li>No, not <strong>yet</strong>. (= simple negative answer)</li>
				<li>They haven't met him <strong>yet</strong>. (= simple negative statement)</li>
				<li>Haven't you finished <strong>yet</strong>? (= expressing surprise)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Using Still</h3>
		<p><em>Still</em> expresses continuity. In positive sentences it is placed before the main verb and after auxiliary verbs such as <em>be, have, might, will</em>. If the main verb is <em>to be</em>, then place <em>still</em> after it rather than before. In questions, <em>still</em> goes before the main verb.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>She is <strong>still</strong> waiting for you.</li>
				<li>Jim might <strong>still</strong> want some.</li>
				<li>Do you <strong>still</strong> work for the BBC?</li>
				<li>Are you <strong>still</strong> here?</li>
				<li>I am <strong>still</strong> hungry.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Order of adverbs of time</h3>
		<p>If you need to use more than one adverb of time in a sentence, use them in this order:</p>
		<p><strong>1: how long 2: how often 3: when</strong></p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>1 + 2 : I work (1) <strong>for five hours</strong> (2) <strong>every day</strong></li>
				<li>2 + 3 : The magazine was published (2) <strong>weekly</strong> (3) <strong>last year</strong>.</li>
