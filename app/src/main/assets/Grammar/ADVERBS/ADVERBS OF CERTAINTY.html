	<div class="content">
		<p>Adverbs of certainty express how certain we feel about an action or event. Adverbs of certainty go before the main verb unless the main verb is 'to be', in which case the adverb of certainty goes after.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He <strong>definitely</strong> left the house this morning.</li>
				<li>He <strong>surely</strong> won't forget.</li>
				<li>He is <strong>probably</strong> in the park.</li>
				<li>He is <strong>certainly</strong> a smart man.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>If there is an auxiliary verb, the adverb of certainty goes between the auxiliary and the main verb.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He has <strong>certainly</strong> forgotten the meeting.</li>
				<li>He will <strong>probably</strong> remember tomorrow.</li>
				<li>He is <strong>definitely</strong> running late.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Sometimes these adverbs of certainty can be placed at the beginning of the sentence.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Undoubtedly</strong>, Winston Churchill was a great politician.</li>
				<li><strong>Certainly</strong>, I will be there.</li>
				<li><strong>Probably</strong>, he has forgotten the meeting.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>When the adverb of certainty <em>surely</em> is placed at the beginning of the sentence, it means the speaker thinks something is true, but is looking for confirmation.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Surely</strong> you've got a bicycle.</li>
				<li><strong>Surely</strong> you're not going to wear that to the party.</li>
			</ul>
