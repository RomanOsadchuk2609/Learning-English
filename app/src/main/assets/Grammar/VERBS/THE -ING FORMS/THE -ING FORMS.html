	<h1 class="page-title">The -ing forms</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>A verb ending in <em>-ing</em> is either a present participle or a gerund. These two forms look identical. The difference is in their functions in a sentence.</p>
		<h3>Present participles</h3>
		<p>A present participle is most commonly used as part of the continuous form of a verb, after verbs of perception, after verbs of movement, or as an adjective.</p>
		<h4>Present participles as part of the continuous form of a verb</h4>
		<p>Present participles are an element in all continuous verb forms (past, present, future, conditional, etc.). The helping verb will indicate the tense, while the present participle remains unchanging.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>He <strong>is painting</strong>.</li>
				<li>She <strong>was waiting</strong>.</li>
				<li>They <strong>will be coming</strong>.</li>
				<li>We <strong>would be staying</strong>.</li>
				<li>I <strong>would have been leaving</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Present participles after verbs of perception</h4>
		<p>Present participles can be used after verbs of perception in the pattern <em>verb + object + present participle</em> to indicate the action being perceived.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>We <strong>saw him swimming</strong> across the pond.</li>
				<li>I <strong>watched her painting</strong> Sarah's portrait.</li>
				<li>I couldn't <strong>hear her singing</strong> because of the noise.</li>
				<li>I would like to <strong>see you knitting</strong> sometime.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Present participles after verbs of movement, action, or position, to indicate parallel activity.</h4>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>She <strong>sat looking</strong> at the sea.</li>
				<li>He <strong>walks reading</strong> his newspaper.</li>
				<li>I <strong>cook listening</strong> to the radio.</li>
				<li>Sally <strong>lay listening</strong> to the bugs in the grass.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>Present participles as adjectives</h4>

				<li>This movie is so <strong>exciting</strong>!</li>
				<li>His economics class is <strong>boring</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Gerunds</h3>
		<p>The gerund always has the same function as a noun, although it looks like a verb. It can be used in the same way as a noun.</p>
		<h4>A gerund as the subject of the sentence</h4>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Eating</strong> people is wrong.</li>
				<li><strong>Driving</strong> too fast is dangerous.</li>
				<li><strong>Walking</strong> is good for you.</li>
				<li>Your <strong>knitting</strong> is beautiful.</li>
			</ul>

				<li>She is good <strong>at painting</strong>.</li>
				<li>I was the fastest <strong>at climbing</strong> the rope.</li>
				<li>He learns music <strong>by listening</strong> to the chords.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>A gerund after certain specific verbs</h4>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>

				<li>He <strong>enjoys walking</strong>.</li>
