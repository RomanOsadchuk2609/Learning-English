	<h1 class="page-title">Distributives for pairs of objects</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The distributive determiners <em>both, either</em> and <em>neither</em> are concerned with distribution between a pair of objects. Normally, these words cannot be used to refer to a group of three or more individuals. They also cannot be used to refer to a group of indefinite size. These distributives can only refer to countable nouns.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Using "both"</h3>
		<p><em>Both</em> refers to the whole pair and is equivalent to "one and the other". Both can be used with plural nouns on its own, or it can be followed by "of", with or without an article. When followed by a plural pronoun, <em>both</em> must be separated from the pronoun by "of". <em>Both</em> cannot be used with singular nouns, because it refers to two things.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Both children</strong> were born in Italy.</li>
				<li><strong>Both the children</strong> were born in Italy.</li>
				<li><strong>Both of the children</strong> were born in Italy.</li>
				<li><strong>Both my parents</strong> have fair hair.</li>
				<li><strong>Both of my parents</strong> have fair hair.</li>
				<li><strong>Both of us</strong> like skiing.</li>
				<li>I told <strong>both of them</strong> to calm down.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Using "either"</h3>
		<p><em>Either</em> is positive and when used alone, refers to one of the two members of the pair. It is equivalent to "one or the other". Because it refers to just one member of a pair, <em>either</em> must be used before a singular noun. It can also be used with a plural noun or pronoun if followed by "of".</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I can stay at <strong>either hotel</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Either day</strong> is fine for me.</li>
				<li>There are two chairs here. You can take <strong>either of them</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Either of you</strong> can come.</li>
				<li><strong>Either of the hotels</strong> will be fine.</li>
				<li>I can eat <strong>either of the salads</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>Either</em> can also be used with <em>or</em> in a construction that talks about each member of the pair in turn. The meaning remains the same, but in this case <em>either</em> is not functioning as a distributive. It is functioning as a conjunction.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>You can have <strong>either</strong> ice cream <strong>or</strong> chocolate cake.</li>
				<li>I will come on <strong>either</strong> Thursday <strong>or</strong> Friday.</li>
				<li>You can <strong>either</strong> come inside <strong>or</strong> put on your raincoat.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Using "neither"</h3>
		<p><em>Neither</em> is negative and when used alone, refers to the whole pair. It is equivalent to "not one or the other". Because it refers to just one member of a pair, <em>neither</em> must be used before a singular noun. It can also be used with a plural noun or pronoun if followed by "of".</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Neither chair</strong> is any good.</li>
				<li><strong>Neither brother</strong> came.</li>
				<li>Which bag do you want? <strong>Neither of them</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Neither of us</strong> were on time.</li>
				<li>I think <strong>neither of these dresses</strong> fits me.</li>
				<li><strong>Neither of the children</strong> wanted to go.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><em>Neither</em> can also be used with <em>nor</em> in a construction that talks about each member of the pair in turn. The meaning remains the same, but in this case <em>neither</em> is not functioning as a distributive. It is functioning as a conjunction.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<h5>Examples</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>You can have <strong>neither</strong> cookies <strong>nor</strong> candy.</li>
				<li>It is <strong>neither</strong> raining <strong>nor</strong> snowing.</li>
				<li>She is <strong>neither</strong> tall <strong>nor</strong> short.</li>
			</ul>
